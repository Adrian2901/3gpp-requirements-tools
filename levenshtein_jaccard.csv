Communication services supporting cyber-physical control applications need to be ultra-reliable and, in some cases, the end-to-end latency must be very low.

Determinism refers to whether the delay between transmission of a message and receipt of the message at the destination address is stable (within bounds). Usually, communication is called deterministic if it is bounded by a given threshold for the latency/transmission time. In case of a periodic transmission, the variation of the interval is bounded.$112$104$209$0.8461538461538461$0.5925925925925926$0.6206896551724138
In some cases, a local approach (e.g. network edge) is preferred for the communication service on the network side in order to reduce the latency, to increase communication service availability, or to keep sensitive data in a non-public network on the factory site.$167$61$192$0.7$0.6129032258064516$0.5405405405405406
Communication service availability is considered an important service performance requirement for cyber-physical applications, especially for applications with deterministic traffic. The communication service availability depends on the latency and reliability (in the context of network layer packet transmissions, as defined in TS 22.261 [2]) of the logical communication link, as well as the survival time of the cyber-physical application (see Annex C.3 for further details on these relations).$232$58$222$0.6216216216216216$0.6451612903225806$0.5476190476190477
High accuracy positioning is becoming essential for Factories of the Future.

<b>1)</b>	<b>Factory automation:</b> Factory automation deals with the automated control, monitoring and optimisation of processes and workflows within a factory. This includes aspects like closed-loop control applications (e.g., based on programmable logic or motion controllers) and robotics, as well as aspects of computer-integrated manufacturing. Factory automation generally represents a key enabler for industrial mass production with high quality and cost-efficiency. Corresponding applications are often characterised by highest requirements on the underlying communication infrastructure, especially in terms of communication service availability, determinism, and latency. In the Factories of the Future, static sequential production systems will be more and more replaced by novel modular production systems offering a high flexibility and versatility. This involves many increasingly mobile production assets, for which powerful wireless communication and localisation services are required. $105$131$192$0.8387096774193549$0.5641025641025641$0.55
5)	<b>Monitoring and maintenance</b>: Monitoring of certain processes and/or assets in the context of industrial production without an immediate impact on the processes themselves (in contrast to a typical closed-loop control system in factory automation, for example). This particularly includes applications such as condition monitoring and predictive maintenance based on sensor data, but also big data analytics for optimising future parameter sets of a certain process, for instance. For these use cases, the data acquisition process is typically not latency-critical.$181$63$173$0.5454545454545454$0.5357142857142857$0.5625

The exchange of control commands and control feedback is done with periodic deterministic communication and using time-sensitive networking.$154$0$154$0.875$1.0$0.875
In the closed-loop control use case for process automation, several sensors are installed in a plant and each sensor performs continuous measurements. The measurement data are transported to a controller, which takes decision to set actuators. The latency and determinism in this use case are crucial. This use case has very stringent requirements in terms of latency and service availability. The required service area is usually bigger than for motion control use cases. Interaction with the public network (e.g., service continuity, roaming) is not required.$209$86$225$0.7586206896551724$0.5428571428571428$0.5641025641025641

In another case, using telemetry data as input, the digital twin model’s output may be fed to an AR server for sending low latency AR streams toward the manual operator in the factory production area. At the same time, it can further be utilized as input by an AI/ML model.  A process control function can compare the machine data (example:position, rotation level, speed, sensor data, high-speed photography etc.) and perhaps a high-resolution video from the manufacturing line and  if necessary, it can send commands for corrective measure. In this example, the process control functions reside at the edge infrastructure and the inspection related corrective input is sent back to the production system control function.$167$344$210$0.8235294117647058$0.4857142857142857$0.5882352941176471

Due to the criticality of these safety functions, safety control panels currently have mostly a wire-bound connection to the equipment they control. In consequence, there tend to be many such panels for the many machines and production units that typically can be found in a factory. With an ultra-reliable low-latency wireless link, it would be possible to connect such mobile control panels with safety functions wirelessly. This would lead to a higher usability and would allow for the flexible and easy re-use of panels for controlling different machines. $194$139$218$0.8928571428571429$0.5454545454545454$0.5882352941176471
The service bit rate per controller is low in steady state, but GOOSE bursts with high service bit rate do occur, especially during fault situations. GOOSE messages are sent by several or all controller units of the feeder nearly at the same point in time during the fault location, isolation and service restoration procedure with a low end-to-end latency. $213$101$253$0.9$0.5454545454545454$0.5294117647058824
High-speed current differential protection, which is required for sub-millisecond fault detection, is another typical use case of power distribution automation. The approach utilises differential current measurements to significantly reduce fault detection time. The protection relays exchange the current samples via the 5G system. Each relay then compares the sent and received samples to determine if a fault has occurred in a protected area. This is done in order to identify and isolate a fault in the grid. The sampling rate varies and is dependent on the algorithms designed by the manufacturers. A protection relay collects the current samples (with the typical message size of up to 245 bytes) at a frequency of 600 Hz, 1200 Hz, 1600 Hz, or 3000 Hz. The exchange of measurement samples is done in a strictly cyclic and deterministic manner. With the sampling rate of 600 Hz, the transfer interval is 1.7 ms and the required bandwidth 1.2 Mbit/s; for 1200 Hz, the transfer interval is 0.83 ms and the required bandwidth 2.4 Mbit/s. The maximum allowed end-to-end delay between two protection relays is between 5 ms and 10 ms, depending on the voltage (see  IEC 61850-90-1 for more details [28]). For some legacy systems, the latency usually is set to 15 ms. The associated KPIs are provided in Table A.4.4.4-1.$288$355$228$0.7272727272727273$0.5263157894736842$0.5588235294117647

On this matter, 5G enables shifting care location from hospitals to homes and others lower cost facilities which mechanically translates into more savings. Additionally, another example showing that 5G can enable cost savings required by the medical industry can be found inside hospitals where wireless transmission of low latency data streams improves operating room planning, enable streamlining equipment usage and simplifies operating theater implementation.$173$75$156$0.7857142857142857$0.65625$0.6857142857142857

The conditions that influence the behaviour of wireless communication are framed by the communication requirements of the application (e.g., end-to-end latency), the characteristics of the communication system (e.g., output power of a transmitter), and the transmission conditions of the media (e.g., signal fluctuations caused by multipath propagation). $57$127$139$0.8846153846153846$0.6129032258064516$0.59375

"There are several time parameters in dependability assessment. A required value is specified for every time parameter. This value can be a maximum, mean, modal, minimum etc. Typically, there is a deviation from the desired value to the actual value. Jitter is often used to characterise this variation. Since jitter generally is used for characterising the behaviour of a measured parameter, for instance the scatter of measured end-to-end latencies (""the world as it is""), it can be quite confusing to use it for formulating service performance requirements (""the world as we want it to be""). What is needed is a concept and related parameters that allow for formulating and talking about the end-to-end latency requirements in Clause 5 and Annex A."$140$182$201$0.7666666666666667$0.625$0.6451612903225806

In 5G networks, the end-to-end latency KPI is a critical KPI in order to ensure that the network can deliver the packet within a time limit specified by an application: not too early and not too late. $47$79$123$0.967741935483871$0.7878787878787878$0.8181818181818182
In cyber-physical automation, the arrival time of a specific packet should be strictly inside a prescribed time window. In other words, a strict time boundary applies: [minimum end-to-end latency, maximum end-to-end latency]. Otherwise, the transmission is erroneous. Although most use cases that require timely delivery only specify the maximum end-to-end latency, the minimum latency is also sometimes prescribed. In the latter case, a communication error occurs if the packet is delivered earlier than the minimum end-to-end latency. An example for a related application is putting labels at a specific location on moving objects, and the arrival of a message is interpreted as a trigger for this action. In other words, the application does not keep its own time, but interprets the message arrival as clock signal. Maximum and minimum end-to-end latency alone do not disclose which value is preferred, i.e. target value. The next three subclauses introduce concepts help with relating maximum end-to-end latency, minimum end-to-end latency, and target vale to each other. $149$183$204$0.8484848484848485$0.896551724137931$0.8125
"A message reception is considered in time, if it is received within the timeliness interval. If it is received outside the timeliness interval, the message reception is considered invalid. This is related to the communication error ""unacceptable deviation from target end-to-end latency"" (see Subclause B.6). In other words, maximum end-to-end latency = <i>t</i><sub>UB</sub> and minimum end-to-end latency = <i>t</i><sub>LB</sub>."$93$117$169$0.6285714285714286$0.5625$0.5405405405405406

This scenario describes unicast communication of evenly interspersed packets from application A to B. The packets are handed over at the communication service interface A from the application to the communication network, and the packets are then transmitted to the end node B. However, only every second packet is actually successfully handed over to end node A and then transmitted to end node B. Thus, only half of the packets arrive at application B. Note though that the reliability of the mobile network is 100%, since all packets transmitted by end node A are delivered to end node B within the time constraint required by the targeted service. However, depending on the agreed QoS, the communication service availability can be of the same value as the reliability or much lower. For instance, if the agreed survival time is equal to or larger than the end-to-end latency, reliability and communication service availability are equal. However, if the survival time is smaller, the reliability is two times the communication service availability. $102$297$277$0.9714285714285714$0.7142857142857143$0.7352941176470589
