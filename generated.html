      <td>4.1 General Requirements for Edge Computing in 23548-i20.docx\n\n4.1.1 Edge Computing Concept:\nEdge Computing is defined as a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed, to improve response times and save bandwidth. In the context of 23548-i20.docx, Edge Computing enables operator and third-party services to be hosted near the User Equipment's (UE's) access point of attachment. This proximity facilitates efficient service delivery by reducing end-to-end latency and the load on the transport network.\n\n4.1.2 Support for Edge Hosting Environment (EHE):\nThe 23548-i20.docx specification supports the deployment of Edge Hosting Environments (EHE) beyond the Public Switched Access Function (PSAF) Universal Profile Function (UPF). These EHEs can be managed by either the operator or third parties, providing flexibility in the deployment and management of edge computing services.\n\n4.1.3 Applicability to PLMN and SNPN:\nThe Edge Computing features outlined in the 23548-i20.docx specification are applicable to both Public Land Mobile Networks (PLMN) and Signalling Networks (SNPN). This ensures that the benefits of Edge Computing can be leveraged across different network layers and types.\n\n4.1.4 Local Part of the DN for EHE Deployment:\nThe Local Part of the Domain Name (DN) in which the EHE is deployed may have user plane connectivity with both a centrally deployed Public Switched Access Function (PSAF) and a locally deployed PSAF of the same Domain Name Network (DNN). This connectivity allows for efficient routing and traffic steering, as well as session and service continuity.\n\n4.1.5 AF Influenced Traffic Routing:\nThe 23548-i20.docx specification leverages Local Access Function (LAF) enablers, as described in clause 5.13 of TS 23.501 [2], to influence Access Function (AF</td>

      <td>Based on the provided information from the 23548-i20.docx, the following requirements can be derived for the section 6.3.1 General:\n\n1. Edge Relocation refers to the procedures supporting EAS (Edge Application Service) changes and/or PSA (Protocol Support Architecture) UPF (User Plane Function) relocation.\n\n2. Edge Relocation may be triggered by an AF (Access Federation) request due to load balance between EAS instances in the EHE (Evolved Higher Evolved Node) or by the network, such as UE (User Equipment) mobility.\n\n3.

      <td>The requirement for section 6.4.1 General, as per the 23548-i20.docx, should encompass the following points:\n\n1.
