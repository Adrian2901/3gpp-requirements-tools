      <td>**4.1 General Requirements for Edge Computing**\n\n4.1.1 **Purpose and Scope**\n\nThis section outlines the general requirements for Edge Computing within the context of 5G networks. Edge Computing is designed to host operator and third-party services close to the User Equipment (UE)'s access point of attachment. The primary objectives are to achieve efficient service delivery through reduced end-to-end latency and load on the transport network.\n\n4.1.2 **Edge Hosting Environment (EHE)**\n\n- The Edge Hosting Environment (EHE) should support the deployment of services beyond the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) Universal Profile (UPF). This includes support for both operator-controlled and third-party-controlled EHEs.\n\n- The EHE should be applicable to both Public Land Mobile Networks (PLMN) and System Nodes of Public Land Mobile Networks (SNPN).\n\n4.1.3 **Latency and Load Reduction**\n\n- Edge Computing should contribute to the reduction of end-to-end latency and the load on the transport network. This is achieved by hosting services closer to the UE, thereby minimizing the distance data must travel.\n\n4.1.4 **Local Connectivity and Routing**\n\n- The Local part of the Distribution Network Node (DN) in which EHE is deployed should maintain user plane connectivity with both centrally deployed PSA and locally deployed PSA of the same Distribution Network Node (DNN).\n\n- Edge Computing enablers, as described in clause 5.13 of TS 23.501 [2], should be leveraged. These enablers include local routing and traffic steering, session and service continuity, and Automated Frequency (AF) influenced traffic routing.\n\n4.1.5 **Service Selection and Edge Computing Related DNN**\n\n- While the serving network supports Edge Computing, particularly for Local Break Out roaming scenarios in PLMN access cases, it does not have control over the User Requested Service Point (URSP) rules for Automated Frequency (AF) guidance to the Packet Control Function (PCF).\n\n- Consequently, the serving network</td>

      <td>6.3.1 General:\n\nThis section outlines the general procedures and mechanisms related to Edge Relocation, which encompasses the processes supporting EAS (Edge Application Service) changes and/or PSA (Protocol Support Annex) UPF (User Plane Function) relocation. The following key aspects are defined:\n\n- Edge Relocation: The process of reconfiguring the user plane path to maintain optimal performance. This can be initiated by an Application Function (AF) request, such as load balancing between EAS instances in the Evolved Home Agent (EHE), or by the network, for instance, due to User Equipment (UE) mobility.\n\n- Triggering Factors: Edge Relocation can be triggered by an AF request, such as load balancing, or by the network, for example, due to UE mobility.\n\n- Mechanisms: The following mechanisms are employed during Edge Relocation:\n\n  1. PDU Session Re-establishment: This involves re-establishing the PDU Session using SSC (Sesshop and Session Control) mode 2/3 mechanisms or Local PSA UPF relocation using UL (User Layer) CL (Connection Layer) and BP (Bearer Protocol) mechanisms. The procedures for these mechanisms are detailed in TS 23.501[2] and TS 23.502[3].\n\n  2. EAS Re-discovery: When Edge Relocation occurs, the UE may need to re-discover a new EAS to continue the service. The re-discovery process is specified in clause 6.2.\n\n  3. AF Relocation: Edge Relocation may result in the relocation of an AF, for example, as part of the initial PDU Session Establishment. Another AF serving the Edge Applications may be selected.\n\n  4. Packet Buffering: Some EAS (re)Discovery procedures in clause 6.2 may trigger Edge Relocation, which may result in packet buffering for low Packet Loss.\n\n  5. User Plane Latency Requirements: Edge Relocation may also consider User Plane Latency Requirements.\n\n</td>

This decision-making process is influenced by the AF's traffic steering enforcement control, which is informed to the SMF via the Access Control Function (ACF) once the user plane latency requirements are authorized by the Policy Control Function (PCF).\n\nThe SMF shall use the maximum allowed user plane latency value provided by the AF to determine whether edge relocation is necessary to ensure that the user plane latency does not exceed this value. If the serving PDUE does not satisfy the maximum allowed user plane latency, the SMF may opt to relocate the PDUE to a target PDUEF that meets the latency requirements. In such cases, the SMF shall select the PDUEF with the shortest user plane latency among those satisfying the maximum user plane latency requirements.\n\nThe PCF is responsible for authorizing the AF's request for user plane latency requirements. The PCF checks whether the AF has the authority to make such a request. Once authorized, the AF's request, including the latency requirements, is communicated to the SMF via the ACF.\n\nUpon receiving the user plane latency requirements from the AF, the SMF may take appropriate actions to meet these requirements. This may involve reconfiguring the user plane of the Packet Data Unit (PDU) Session, as described in step 6 of Figure 4.3.6.2-1 in TS 23.502[3].</td>

      <td>6.4.1 General:\n\nThis section outlines the general requirements for exposing real-time network information, such as user path latency, which are beneficial for the application layer. Specifically, the Local PSA User Profile Format (UPF) is mandated to expose Quality of Service (QoS) monitoring results as per clause 5.33.3 of Technical Specification (TS) 23.501[2]. These results are intended to be delivered to the local Application Formation (AF) through the L-PSA UPF mechanism.\n\nIt is important to note that the method of delivering this information over the Network Interface (N6) is not covered in this document. This aspect is considered beyond the scope of the current release.\n\nFurthermore, it is crucial to ensure that the QoS monitoring information is properly integrated over time and not sent with an excessively high frequency. This is to mitigate the risk of the application layer over-reacting to transient radio events or conditions. Such over-reactions could potentially lead to service instability. Therefore, the frequency of information delivery should be managed carefully to maintain a stable and reliable service.</td>
