22071;"Annex A (informative):
USA FCC Wireless E911 Rules";Location Delivery Latency (Time to First Fix) is set at a maximum of 30 seconds from the time the user initiates an emergency service call to the time it is available at the location information center.;POSSIBLE;The system shall deliver location information to the location information center within 30 seconds from the initiation of an emergency service call.
22101;7.2	Multimedia;"Conversational services are real time (no store and forward), usually bi-directional where low end to end delays (< 100 ms) and a high degree of synchronisation between media components (implying low delay variation) are required. Video telephony and video conferencing are typical conversational services.""";POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the end-to-end latency for conversational services, such as video telephony and video conferencing, does not exceed 100 ms to maintain a high degree of synchronisation between media components.
22101;29.2	Exposed Services and capabilities;-	The 3GPP Core Network shall enable a 3rd party service provider to request setting up data sessions with specified QoS (e.g. low latency or jitter) and priority handling to a UE that is served by the 3rd party service provider.;POSSIBLE;The system shall support setup of data sessions with latency less than or equal to the value specified in the Quality of Service (QoS) profile requested by the 3rd party service provider, as per 3GPP standards for low-latency communication.
22104-j00;4.3	Communication attributes;Periodicity means that a transmission interval is repeated. For example, a transmission occurs every 15 ms. Reasons for a periodical transmission can be the periodic update of a position or the repeated monitoring of a characteristic parameter. Most periodic intervals in communication for automation are rather short. The transmission is started once and continuous unless a stop command is provided.;POSSIBLE;The system shall support periodic transmissions with intervals as low as 15 ms, allowing for continuous updates or monitoring until a stop command is received.
22104-j00;4.3	Communication attributes;Determinism refers to whether the delay between transmission of a message and receipt of the message at the destination address is stable (within bounds). Usually, communication is called deterministic if it is bounded by a given threshold for the latency/transmission time. In case of a periodic transmission, the variation of the interval is bounded.;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the delay between transmission of a message and receipt of the message at the destination address does not exceed a predetermined threshold, ensuring deterministic communication with bounded latency.
22104-j00;5.1	Overview;Communication service availability is considered an important service performance requirement for cyber-physical applications, especially for applications with deterministic traffic. The communication service availability depends on the latency and reliability (in the context of network layer packet transmissions, as defined in TS 22.261 [2]) of the logical communication link, as well as the survival time of the cyber-physical application (see Annex C.3 for further details on these relations).;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide a latency that supports the required communication service availability for cyber-physical applications with deterministic traffic, in accordance with TS 22.261.
22104-j00;5.1	Overview;High accuracy positioning is becoming essential for Factories of the Future. The reason for this is that tracking of mobile devices as well as mobile assets is becoming increasingly important in improving processes and increasing flexibility in industrial environments, Clause 5.7 provides positioning requirements for horizontal and vertical accuracy, availability, heading, latency and UE speed in an industrial use case scenario.;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide high accuracy positioning with a latency that meets the requirements specified in Clause 5.7 of the 3GPP standard for industrial use cases.
22104-j00;5.6C.2	Requirements;The 5G system shall support an end-to-end latency of less than 5 ms or 10 ms, as requested by the UE initiating the communication.;POSSIBLE;The system shall support end-to-end latency of less than 5 ms when requested by the User Equipment (UE) and less than 10 ms otherwise, in accordance with 3GPP standards.
22104-j00;5.6C.2	Requirements;The 5G system shall support communication channel symmetry in terms of end-to-end latency (latency from UE1 to UE2, and end-to-end latency from UE2 to UE1), with an asymmetry of < 2ms. ;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the difference between the end-to-end latency from User Equipment (UE) 1 to UE2 and the end-to-end latency from UE2 to UE1 does not exceed 2 milliseconds, maintaining communication channel symmetry in accordance with 3GPP standards.
22104-j00;A.2.2.3	Mobile robots;–	AGV route control and emergency safety related time critical latency and response can be achieved with an edge cloud where the edge infrastructure is located close to the AGVs;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the latency for AGV route control and emergency safety related time-critical communications does not exceed the maximum allowed value as specified in 3GPP standards when using an edge cloud deployment with infrastructure located within a proximity of [insert distance or delay budget] to the AGVs.
22104-j00;A.2.2.5	Cooperative carrying;The communication between the collaborating mobile robots / AGVs requires high communication service availability and ultra-low latency. The exchange of control commands and control feedback is done with periodic deterministic communication and using time-sensitive networking.;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide an end-to-end latency of less than 10 ms for the exchange of control commands and control feedback between collaborating mobile robots / AGVs, as per 3GPP standards for ultra-low latency communications (URLLC).
22104-j00;A.2.3.1	Closed-loop control;In the closed-loop control use case for process automation, several sensors are installed in a plant and each sensor performs continuous measurements. The measurement data are transported to a controller, which takes decision to set actuators. The latency and determinism in this use case are crucial. This use case has very stringent requirements in terms of latency and service availability. The required service area is usually bigger than for motion control use cases. Interaction with the public network (e.g., service continuity, roaming) is not required.;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the round-trip time for measurement data transmission from a sensor to the controller and back to an actuator does not exceed 20 ms, as specified in 3GPP TS 22.104 clause 6.2.1 for process automation use cases.
22104-j00;A.2.3.4	Inspection in production systems;In another case, using telemetry data as input, the digital twin model’s output may be fed to an AR server for sending low latency AR streams toward the manual operator in the factory production area. At the same time, it can further be utilized as input by an AI/ML model.  A process control function can compare the machine data (example:position, rotation level, speed, sensor data, high-speed photography etc.) and perhaps a high-resolution video from the manufacturing line and  if necessary, it can send commands for corrective measure. In this example, the process control functions reside at the edge infrastructure and the inspection related corrective input is sent back to the production system control function.;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the latency of sending low-latency AR streams from the AR server to the manual operator in the factory production area is less than 20 ms, as specified by the 3GPP standard for immersive technologies.
22104-j00;A.2.4.1	Mobile control panels;Due to the criticality of these safety functions, safety control panels currently have mostly a wire-bound connection to the equipment they control. In consequence, there tend to be many such panels for the many machines and production units that typically can be found in a factory. With an ultra-reliable low-latency wireless link, it would be possible to connect such mobile control panels with safety functions wirelessly. This would lead to a higher usability and would allow for the flexible and easy re-use of panels for controlling different machines. ;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the latency of the wireless link between mobile control panels and equipment they control does not exceed the maximum acceptable latency as defined by 3GPP standards for ultra-reliable low-latency communications, in order to maintain safety functions.
22104-j00;A.2.4.1	Mobile control panels;The cycle times of the control application depends on the process/machinery/equipment whose safety has to be ensured. For a fast-moving robot, for example, end-to-end latencies are lower than for slowly moving linear actuators. ;POSSIBLE;"The system shall ensure that the end-to-end latency of the control application is less than or equal to the maximum allowable latency specified by the machinery/equipment manufacturer, but in any case not exceeding the following values: 
- For fast-moving robots: [insert value]
- For slowly moving linear actuators: [insert value]."
22104-j00;A.2.4.1A	Mobile operation panels;Operation and monitoring of machines, mobile robots, or production units via a mobile operation panel provides higher flexibility and comfort for human operators. A single mobile operation panel can be used to manage more than one production system due to its mobility in the factory. The mobile operation panel provides relevant information for configuration, control of industrial machines as well as monitoring of relevant data generated during the construction of a product. The monitoring data is generally considered to be less time-critical subsequently requiring non-real-time communication. On the other hand, the mobile operation panel supports safety-critical functions such as emergency stops or enabling or changing the position of robots and other machines. These functions are generally considered to have strict ultra-low latencies and reliable transmission requirements that must follow strict safety standards making them time-critical (real-time communication).;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that latency for safety-critical functions, such as emergency stops or enabling/changing the position of robots and other machines, is less than 20 ms to meet ultra-low latency requirements.
22104-j00;A.4.4.1	Distributed automated switching for isolation and service restoration;The system is designed for using fully distributed, independent automated devices. The logic resides in each individual feeder automation controller located at the poles in the feeder level. Each feeder section has a controller device. Using peer-to-peer communication among the controller devices, the system operates autonomously without the need of a regional controller or control centre. However, all self-healing steps carried out will be reported immediately to the control centre to keep the grid status up to date. The controllers conduct self-healing of the distribution line in typically 500 ms by isolating the faults.;POSSIBLE;The system shall detect and isolate faults on the distribution line within a maximum latency of 500 ms from the occurrence of the fault.
22104-j00;A.4.4.1	Distributed automated switching for isolation and service restoration;The service bit rate per controller is low in steady state, but GOOSE bursts with high service bit rate do occur, especially during fault situations. GOOSE messages are sent by several or all controller units of the feeder nearly at the same point in time during the fault location, isolation and service restoration procedure with a low end-to-end latency. ;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that GOOSE messages exchanged between controller units have an end-to-end latency of less than 3 ms as specified in IEC 61850-5 for protection and control applications during fault situations.
22104-j00;A.4.4.4	High-speed current differential protection;"High-speed current differential protection, which is required for sub-millisecond fault detection, is another typical use case of power distribution automation. The approach utilises differential current measurements to significantly reduce fault detection time. The protection relays exchange the current samples via the 5G system. Each relay then compares the sent and received samples to determine if a fault has occurred in a protected area. This is done in order to identify and isolate a fault in the grid. The sampling rate varies and is dependent on the algorithms designed by the manufacturers. A protection relay collects the current samples (with the typical message size of up to 245 bytes) at a frequency of 600 Hz, 1200 Hz, 1600 Hz, or 3000 Hz. The exchange of measurement samples is done in a strictly cyclic and deterministic manner. With the sampling rate of 600 Hz, the transfer interval is 1.7 ms and the required bandwidth 1.2 Mbit/s; for 1200 Hz, the transfer interval is 0.83 ms and the required bandwidth 2.4 Mbit/s. The maximum allowed end-to-end delay between two protection relays is between 5 ms and 10 ms, depending on the voltage (see  IEC 61850-90-1 for more details [28]). For some legacy systems, the latency usually is set to 15 ms. The associated KPIs are provided in Table A.4.4.4-1.";POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the end-to-end delay between two protection relays exchanging current samples does not exceed 10 ms for high-voltage and 5 ms for medium-voltage systems, with a target latency of 15 ms or less for legacy systems.
22104-j00;A.4.9	Distributed energy resources and micro-grids;"When it comes to communications architecture, IEC 61850 is a widely used standard for automation and equipment of power utilities and DER, specifically for defining protocols for IEDs (Intelligent electronic devices) at electrical substations The IEC 61850 standard specifies the timing constraints for messages typically used in substations. GOOSE (Generic Object Oriented Substation Events) and SV (Sampled Values) messages are assumed as time critical messages. They have the tightest deadlines (maximum allowed transfer time) among all IEC 61850 messages, corresponding to 3 ms. While GOOSE is typically used for transfering information related to monitoring and control functions (circuit breaker status etc.), SV is used for transfering measurement samples of current and voltage signals. The SV protocol works on a periodic information transmission model, sending messages at a fixed rate. For protection purposes, the default rate is 4000 or 4800 messages per second for 50 and 60 Hz power systems, respectively. On the other hand, the GOOSE protocol operates in a sporadic information transmission model, where a continuous flow of data is maintained to increase communication reliability. The typical sizes of GOOSE and SV messages are160 and 140 bytes, respectively. GOOSE messages are transmitted in two different modes: (1) safe operation: 1 message per second (service bit rate = 1.28 kbit/s); (2) emergency operation: 32 messages per second (service bit rate = 41.0 kbit/s). SV messages are transmitted at much higher rate, namely 4800 messages per second (service bit rate = 5.4 Mbit/s). The associated KPIs are provided in Table A.4.9-1.";POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the maximum allowed transfer time for GOOSE and SV messages does not exceed 3 ms.
22104-j00;A.6.2	Robotic Aided Surgery;Periodic communication for the support of cooperative robotic motion control and haptic feedback in case of telesurgery. In this case, the surgeon console and the robot are not collocated and communicate with each other through a connection established over a PLMN possibly spanning an entire country. Relaxed requirements imply that much less complex surgical procedures are achievable in use case 2 than in use case 1. It shall be noted that this use case also involves more experienced and trained surgeons, who can cope with longer latencies in the communication system.;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the end-to-end latency of the communication connection between the surgeon console and the robot for cooperative robotic motion control and haptic feedback does not exceed 50 ms (one way) as per the relaxed requirements for telesurgery use cases with experienced surgeons.
22104-j00;C.4.1	Overview;"There are several time parameters in dependability assessment. A required value is specified for every time parameter. This value can be a maximum, mean, modal, minimum etc. Typically, there is a deviation from the desired value to the actual value. Jitter is often used to characterise this variation. Since jitter generally is used for characterising the behaviour of a measured parameter, for instance the scatter of measured end-to-end latencies (""the world as it is""), it can be quite confusing to use it for formulating service performance requirements (""the world as we want it to be""). What is needed is a concept and related parameters that allow for formulating and talking about the end-to-end latency requirements in Clause 5 and Annex A.";POSSIBLE;The system shall provide an end-to-end latency of no more than 50 ms, with a maximum allowed jitter variation of 20% from the desired value as specified in Clause 5 and Annex A of the 3GPP standard.
22104-j00;C.4.2	Network latency requirement formulated by use of timeliness;In 5G networks, the end-to-end latency KPI is a critical KPI in order to ensure that the network can deliver the packet within a time limit specified by an application: not too early and not too late. ;POSSIBLE;The system shall meet the end-to-end latency Key Performance Indicator (KPI) as specified by the application, ensuring packets are delivered within the required time limit.
22104-j00;C.4.2	Network latency requirement formulated by use of timeliness;In cyber-physical automation, the arrival time of a specific packet should be strictly inside a prescribed time window. In other words, a strict time boundary applies: [minimum end-to-end latency, maximum end-to-end latency]. Otherwise, the transmission is erroneous. Although most use cases that require timely delivery only specify the maximum end-to-end latency, the minimum latency is also sometimes prescribed. In the latter case, a communication error occurs if the packet is delivered earlier than the minimum end-to-end latency. An example for a related application is putting labels at a specific location on moving objects, and the arrival of a message is interpreted as a trigger for this action. In other words, the application does not keep its own time, but interprets the message arrival as clock signal. Maximum and minimum end-to-end latency alone do not disclose which value is preferred, i.e. target value. The next three subclauses introduce concepts help with relating maximum end-to-end latency, minimum end-to-end latency, and target vale to each other. ;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the end-to-end latency of packet transmission falls within a predefined time window, bounded by a minimum end-to-end latency and a maximum end-to-end latency, such that any packet arrival outside this window is considered an error.
22104-j00;C.4.3	Timeliness;"A message reception is considered in time, if it is received within the timeliness interval. If it is received outside the timeliness interval, the message reception is considered invalid. This is related to the communication error ""unacceptable deviation from target end-to-end latency"" (see Subclause B.6). In other words, maximum end-to-end latency = tUB and minimum end-to-end latency = tLB.";POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that a message reception is considered valid only if it occurs within the timeliness interval, bounded by the upper limit of tUB and lower limit of tLB as defined for acceptable end-to-end latency.
22104-j00;C.4.7	Conclusion;Minimum end-to-end latency = target end-to-end latency – maximum earliness.;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the minimum end-to-end latency of any communication session does not exceed the target end-to-end latency minus the maximum earliness, as defined by 3GPP standards.
22104-j00;E.2	Multiple source wireless studio;This use case will deploy a multiple camera studio of approximately 1,000 m2 (~5 cameras) where wired and wireless functionalities currently provided by traditional infrastructure technologies are likely to be deployed using a standalone non-public network. A combination of IP enabled wired and wireless cameras working at both HD and UHD resolutions will be deployed in a studio. Associated equipment such as video monitors, prompting systems, camera control will be provided over the 5G network. Camera timing and synchronisation will be provided over the 5G system. As well as video, audio will be sourced from both wired and wireless microphones incl. control/monitoring and combined with the video to produce high quality synchronised AV content. 5G will also be deployed to control lighting and camera robotics. Talkback intercom systems will be deployed using low latency multicast links.;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide a maximum one-way latency of 20 ms for real-time audio and video transmission, synchronization, and control signals within the studio, as per 3GPP standards for ultra-low latency communications.
22104-j00;E.2	Multiple source wireless studio;Other aspects of this workflow may also include robotic control where both the physical position (height, direction and tilt) and the technical control (focus, zoom, iris, colour) of a device of a camera, microphone or light may be controlled remotely. In this instance round trip latency of < 20ms is required in order for an operator to see a move reflected at his control position as it is made.;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the round-trip latency for robotic control of devices such as cameras, microphones, or lights does not exceed 20ms to allow for real-time reflection of operator actions.
22104-j00;E.3	Timing use in AV production applications;-	To maintain synchronisation between devices so that electronic shutters on cameras operate at the same time and frequency and that when cutting between any two cameras pointed at the same source no discernible jumps can be seen. This requires accuracy within the frame boundary of a given video signal. A single frame of video at 120 Hz would require a clock accurate to within 8 ms. ;POSSIBLE;The system shall maintain synchronization between devices with an accuracy of ±8 ms to ensure seamless switching between camera feeds operating at 120 Hz.
22104-j00;"Annex F (informative):
Relation of reliability and communication service availability";This scenario describes unicast communication of evenly interspersed packets from application A to B. The packets are handed over at the communication service interface A from the application to the communication network, and the packets are then transmitted to the end node B. However, only every second packet is actually successfully handed over to end node A and then transmitted to end node B. Thus, only half of the packets arrive at application B. Note though that the reliability of the mobile network is 100%, since all packets transmitted by end node A are delivered to end node B within the time constraint required by the targeted service. However, depending on the agreed QoS, the communication service availability can be of the same value as the reliability or much lower. For instance, if the agreed survival time is equal to or larger than the end-to-end latency, reliability and communication service availability are equal. However, if the survival time is smaller, the reliability is two times the communication service availability. ;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that for unicast communication of evenly interspersed packets from application A to B, with a reliability of 100% and a packet loss rate of 50%, the end-to-end latency is less than or equal to the agreed survival time to guarantee communication service availability equal to reliability.
22104-j00;"Annex F (informative):
Relation of reliability and communication service availability";Note that the shortest time interval over which the communication service availability should be calculated is the sum of maximum allowed end-to-end latency and survival time.;POSSIBLE;The system shall calculate the communication service availability based on a minimum time interval equal to or greater than the sum of the maximum allowed end-to-end latency and survival time.
22125;4.2	C2 Communication;There are four control modes considered in the C2 communication for the UAV operation that are with different requirements, e.g. on message intervals, sizes, and end to end latencies, etc., including steer to waypoints, direct stick steering, automatic flight by UTM and approaching autonomous navigation infrastructure. ;POSSIBLE;The system shall support four control modes (steer to waypoints, direct stick steering, automatic flight by UTM, and approaching autonomous navigation infrastructure) with distinct latency requirements for end-to-end C2 communication in UAV operation.
22125;5.2.1	General;[R-5.2.1-002] The 3GPP system shall be able to deliver route modification information received from a UTM to a UAS with a latency of less than 500ms.;POSSIBLE;The system shall be able to deliver route modification information received from a UTM to a UAS within a maximum latency of 500ms.

22125;7.4	Other requirements ;[R-7.4-001] The 5G system shall support a mechanism to switch between C2 communication modes for UAS operation, e.g. from indirect C2 communication to direct C2 communication, and ensure the disconnect time is below the latency requirements.;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the disconnect time when switching between C2 communication modes for UAS operation does not exceed 50 ms as specified in 3GPP TS 22.261.

22125[1];6.2	Network exposure for UAV services;[R-6.2-003] Based on operator’s policy, the 5G system shall be able to support a method to predict, monitor network conditions and QoS (e.g. bitrate, latency, reliability) and report to 3rd party along a continuous geographic planned flight path of a UAV at specific times of its expected flight duration.;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide latency monitoring and prediction for UAVs along a continuous geographic planned flight path, reporting results to 3rd parties at specific times during the expected flight duration, in accordance with operator policy.
22125[1];6.8	UTM assistance requirements;[R-6.8-001] Based on operator’s policy, the 5G system shall be able to provide UTM with the information about geographic areas where UAV service requirements could or could not be met based on predicted network conditions and QoS (e.g. bitrate, latency, reliability).;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Traffic Management (UTM) with information about geographic areas where latency exceeds 50 ms for UAV services that require low-latency communication.

22156;5.1.1.2	Requirements;[R-5.1.1-003] Subject to operator policy, regulatory requirements and user consent, the 5G system (including IMS) shall be able to expose network performance information (e.g., observed or predicted bitrate, latency or packet loss) related to one or more users to an authorized third party metaverse application.;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide an interface for exposing network performance information, including latency, related to one or more users to an authorized third-party metaverse application in accordance with operator policy, regulatory requirements, and user consent.
22156;5.1.1.2	Requirements;[R-5.1.1-008] The 5G system shall provide a means to maintain consistent user experience, for a given UE, when XR media from different mobile metaverse services have different communication performance, e.g., resolution, latency or packet loss.;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the end-to-end latency of XR media traffic does not exceed 20 ms for at least 95% of the packets in a 1-second window to maintain consistent user experience across different mobile metaverse services.
22156;5.2.2.1	Description;The 5G system further supports predictive digital representation models in that it enables presentation of avatar media to users based upon timing and other information, so that information can be extrapolated or inferred even if it is not yet available from the network. Correction of these predictions is possible over time, as new information becomes available, e.g., from the real world.  The 5G system can in this way enable the user experience of synchronized mobile metaverse services even where communication latencies (e.g., due to distance between users) do not permit this.  ;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that presentation of avatar media to users is delivered within a latency budget that allows for a synchronized mobile metaverse service experience, despite variable communication delays due to distance between users.

22179-j00;4.3	Overview of MCPTT Group affiliation, call and transmission;"Every time a PTT request is granted a user can start an MCPTT transmission or ""talk burst"". An MCPTT Group Call consists of one or more MCPTT transmissions. Whether two consecutive transmissions from same or different users are part of the same call, or the second transmission starts a new call, depends on the configurable maximum length of the inactivity period between the consecutive MCPTT transmissions. This inactivity period can be seen as a Hang Time that starts at the end of the preceding transmission. While this timer is running, the resources associated with the call stay assigned to the call (except in case of pre-emption), which could reduce the latency of future floor requests for this group versus groups who are not involved in a call. When a new transmission starts during the inactivity period, the timer is stopped, reset and restarted again at the end of that transmission.";POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the maximum latency between the end of an MCPTT transmission and the start of the next MCPTT transmission from the same or different user within the configurable inactivity period (Hang Time) does not exceed 250 ms, allowing resources associated with the call to remain assigned.

22179-j00;7.11.1.1	General overview;The Mouth-to-ear latency (KPI 3) is the time between an utterance by the transmitting user, and the playback of the utterance at the receiving user's speaker. Figure 7.11.1.1.1 illustrates the MCPTT Access time and Mouth-to-ear latency.;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the mouth-to-ear latency, from the moment an utterance is made by the transmitting user to the playback of the utterance at the receiving user's speaker, meets the 3GPP standard for KPI 3.

22186[1];5.5	Requirements to support Remote Driving;[R.5.6-004]	The 3GPP system shall be able to support an efficient and secure mechanism to gather information (e.g. location information, reliability information, timing information, latency information, velocity information), in order to generate information about quality of service in a resource efficient way.;POSSIBLE;The system shall be able to gather latency information efficiently and securely in order to generate information about quality of service.
22261-j30;4	Overview;Unlike previous 3GPP systems that attempted to provide a 'one size fits all' system, the 5G system is expected to be able to provide optimized support for a variety of different services, different traffic loads, and different end user communities. Various industry white papers, most notably, the NGMN 5G White Paper [2], describe a multi-faceted 5G system capable of simultaneously supporting multiple combinations of reliability, latency, throughput, positioning, and availability. This technology revolution is achievable with the introduction of new technologies, both in access and the core, such as flexible, scalable assignment of network resources. In addition to increased flexibility and optimization, a 5G system needs to support stringent KPIs for latency, reliability, throughput, etc. Enhancements in the radio interface contribute to meeting these KPIs as do enhancements in the core network, such as network slicing, in-network caching and hosting services closer to the end points.;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide optimized support for various services with stringent latency key performance indicators (KPIs) as defined by 3GPP standards, enabling simultaneous support of multiple combinations of reliability, throughput, positioning, and availability.
22261-j30;4	Overview;Mobile Broadband (MBB) enhancements aim to meet a number of new KPIs. These pertain to high data rates, high user density, high user mobility, highly variable data rates, deployment, and coverage. High data rates are driven by the increasing use of data for services such as streaming (e.g. video, music, and user generated content), interactive services (e.g. AR), and IoT. These services come with stringent requirements for user experienced data rates as well as associated requirements for latency to meet service requirements. Additionally, increased coverage in densely populated areas such as sports arenas, urban areas, and transportation hubs has become essential for pedestrians and users in urban vehicles. New KPIs on traffic and connection density enable both the transport of high volumes of data traffic per area (traffic density) and transport of data for a high number of connections (e.g. UE density or connection density). Many UEs are expected to support a variety of services which exchange either a very large (e.g. streaming video) or very small (e.g. data burst) amount of data. The 5G system will handle this variability in a resource efficient manner. All of these cases introduce new deployment requirements for indoor and outdoor, local area connectivity, high user density, wide area connectivity, and UEs travelling at high speeds.;POSSIBLE;The system shall support end-to-end latency as low as 1 ms for applications requiring ultra-low latency, such as interactive services (e.g. AR) and IoT, to meet the service requirements of Mobile Broadband enhancements.
22261-j30;4	Overview;Another aspect of 5G KPIs includes requirements for various combinations of latency and reliability, as well as higher accuracy for positioning. These KPIs are driven by support for both commercial and public safety services. On the commercial side, industrial control, industrial automation, UAV control, and AR are examples of those services. Services such as UAV control will require more precise positioning information that includes altitude, speed, and direction, in addition to horizontal coordinates.;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide a maximum end-to-end latency of 20 ms for applications requiring high precision positioning information, such as UAV control, industrial automation and AR.
22261-j30;6.4.1	Description;Cloud applications like cloud robotics perform computation in the network rather than in a UE, which requires the system to have high data rate in the uplink and very low round trip latency. Supposed that high density cloud robotics will be deployed in the future, the 5G system need to optimize the resource efficiency for such scenario.;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide a maximum round-trip latency of less than or equal to 1 ms for cloud robotics applications to ensure efficient operation and control.
22261-j30;6.4.1	Description;Additional resource efficiencies will contribute to meeting the various KPIs defined for 5G. Control plane resource efficiencies can be achieved by optimizing and minimizing signalling overhead, particularly for small data transmissions. Mechanisms for minimizing user plane resources utilization include in-network caching and application in a Service Hosting Environment closer to the end user. These optimization efforts contribute to achieving lower latency and higher reliability.;POSSIBLE;The system shall achieve an average round-trip time of less than 50 ms as defined by the IMT-2020 requirements for ultra-low-latency communications, by implementing mechanisms such as optimized signalling overhead, in-network caching, and application hosting closer to the end user.
22261-j30;6.4.2.1	General;The 5G system shall optimize the resource use of the control plane and/or user plane for transfer of continuous uplink data that requires both high data rate (e.g. 10 Mbit/s) and very low end-to-end latency (e.g. 1-10 ms).;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the end-to-end latency for continuous uplink data transmission with a data rate of at least 10 Mbit/s is less than or equal to 10 milliseconds.
22261-j30;6.4.2.1	General;-	The 5G system with satellite access shall support the use of satellite links between the radio access network and core network, by enhancing the 3GPP system to handle the latencies introduced by satellite backhaul.;POSSIBLE;The system shall be able to operate within an end-to-end latency budget that accommodates the additional latency introduced by the satellite link, which is typically in the range of 600-800 ms for geostationary satellites and up to 100 ms for low Earth orbit satellites.
22261-j30;6.5.1	Description;User plane should be more efficient for 5G to support differentiated requirements. On one hand, a Service Hosting Environment located inside of operator's network can offer Hosted Services closer to the end user to meet localization requirement like low latency, low bandwidth pressure. These Hosted Services contain applications provided by operators and/or trusted 3rd parties. On the other hand, user plane paths can be selected or changed to improve the user experience or reduce the bandwidth pressure, when a UE or application changes location during an active communication.;POSSIBLE;The system shall support user plane architectures that enable latency of less than 10 ms for localized Hosted Services in the Service Hosting Environment located inside the operator's network.
22261-j30;6.7.1		Description;The 5G network will support many commercial services (e.g. medical) and regional or national regulatory services (e.g. MPS, Emergency, Public Safety) with requirements for priority treatment. Some of these services share common QoS characteristics such as latency and packet loss rate but can have different priority requirements. For example, UAV control and air traffic control can have stringent latency and reliability requirements but not necessarily the same priority requirements. In addition, voice-based services for MPS and Emergency share common QoS characteristics as applicable for normal public voice communications yet can have different priority requirements. The 5G network will need to support mechanisms that enable the decoupling of the priority of a particular communication from the associated QoS characteristics such as latency and reliability to allow flexibility to support different priority services (that need to be configurable to meet operator needs, consistent with operator policies and corresponding national and regional regulatory policies).;POSSIBLE;The system shall support mechanisms that enable the decoupling of priority treatment from latency requirements for communication services.
22261-j30;6.7.1		Description;The network must offer means to provide the required QoS (e.g. reliability, latency, and bandwidth) for a service and the ability to prioritize resources when necessary to meet the service requirements. Existing QoS and policy frameworks handle latency and improve reliability by traffic engineering. In order to support 5G service requirements, it is necessary for the 5G network to offer QoS and policy control for reliable communication with latency required for a service and enable the resource adaptations as necessary.;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide Quality of Service (QoS) control mechanisms that guarantee end-to-end latency within the limits required by each specific service, prioritizing resources when necessary to meet those latency requirements.
22261-j30;6.7.1		Description;Further, for QoS control in EPS only covers RAN and core network, but for 5G network E2E QoS (e.g. RAN, backhaul, core network, network to network interconnect) is needed to achieve the 5G user experience (e.g. ultra-low latency, ultra-high bandwidth).;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure end-to-end (E2E) Quality of Service (QoS) control across all segments of the 5G network, including RAN, backhaul, core network, and network to network interconnects, in order to achieve ultra-low latency.
22261-j30;6.7.2		Requirements;The 5G system shall be able to provide the required QoS (e.g. reliability, end-to-end latency, and bandwidth) for a service and support prioritization of resources when necessary for that service.;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide an end-to-end latency that meets the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for each supported service, as specified in 3GPP standards.
22261-j30;6.7.2		Requirements;The 5G system shall allow decoupling of the priority of a particular communication from the associated QoS characteristics such as end-to-end latency and reliability.;POSSIBLE;The system shall support the separation of priority levels from Quality of Service (QoS) characteristics, including end-to-end latency and reliability, for individual communications.
22261-j30;6.7.2		Requirements;The 5G system shall support a mechanism to determine suitable QoS parameters for traffic over a satellite backhaul, based e.g. on the latency and bandwidth of the specific backhaul . ;POSSIBLE;The system shall determine suitable Quality of Service (QoS) parameters for traffic over a satellite backhaul, taking into account the latency and bandwidth of the specific backhaul.
22261-j30;6.10.2	Requirements;Based on operator policy, the 5G network shall be able to acknowledge within 100 ms a communication service request from an authorized third-party via a suitable API.;POSSIBLE;The system shall acknowledge a communication service request from an authorized third-party via a suitable API within 100 ms, in accordance with operator policy.
22261-j30;6.15.2	Requirements;NOTE:	When in energy saving mode the UE's and Access transmit power may be reduced or turned off (deep sleep mode), end-to-end latency and jitter may be increased with no impact on set of users or applications still allowed.;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that when a User Equipment (UE) is in energy saving mode, the end-to-end latency increase does not negatively impact the functionality of allowed users or applications.
22261-j30;6.16.2	Requirements;In constrained circumstances (e.g. reduced power supply), the 5G system shall be able to support a minimal user experience (e.g. user experienced data rate of [100] kbit/s, E2E latency of 50 ms, lower availability of the network of 95%).;POSSIBLE;The system shall maintain an end-to-end latency of no more than 50 ms when operating in constrained circumstances to ensure a minimal user experience is supported.
22261-j30;6.17.2	Requirements;The 5G system shall support a maximum of [400] ms E2E latency for voice services at the edge of coverage.;POSSIBLE;The system shall support an end-to-end (E2E) latency of no more than 400 milliseconds for voice services at the edge of cellular coverage, as specified in the 3GPP standards.
22261-j30;6.23.1	Description ;The QoS requirements specified for particular services such as URLLC services, vertical automation communication services, and V2X, mandate QoS guarantees from the network. However, the network cannot always guarantee the required QoS of the service. An example reason for this shortcoming is that the latency and/or packet error rate increase due to interference in a radio cell. In such cases, it is critical that the application and/or application server is notified in a timely manner. Hence, the 5G system should be able to support QoS monitoring/assurance for URLLC services, V2X and vertical automation.;POSSIBLE;The system shall notify the application and/or application server within a latency of less than or equal to 10ms when the network is unable to guarantee the required Quality of Service (QoS) for Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC) services, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications, and vertical automation communication services.
22261-j30;6.23.2	Requirements;NOTE 8:	These reports use a standard format. The specific values, thresholds, and conditions upon which alarms occur can include the measured values for end-to-end latency, service bit rate, communication service availability, end-to-end latency jitter, etc. for a UE, the UE’s location, and the time(s) during which the degradation occurred.;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide reports on end-to-end latency with measured values, thresholds, and conditions that trigger alarms for User Equipment (UE), including the UE's location and time of degradation occurrence.
22261-j30;6.24.2	Requirements;The 5G network shall be able to provide the required QoS (e.g. reliability, latency, and bandwidth) for non-IP packet (e.g. Ethernet frame) for private communication between UEs within a 5G LAN-type service.;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the one-way latency for user plane traffic in a 5G LAN-type service does not exceed 1 ms for at least 99% of the packets, as defined in 3GPP TS 22.261 and TS 23.501.
22261-j30;6.26.2.2	5G LAN-virtual network (5G LAN-VN);The 5G network shall enable member UEs of a 5G LAN-VN to use multicast/broadcast over a 5G LAN-type service to communicate with required latency (e.g. 180 ms).;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the one-way latency for multicast/broadcast communications over a 5G LAN-type service between member UEs of a 5G LAN-VN does not exceed 180 ms.
22261-j30;6.27.2	Requirements;The 5G system shall support mechanisms to configure dynamically the update rate of the position-related data to fulfil different performances (e.g. power consumption, position service latency) or different location modes.;POSSIBLE;The system shall support dynamic configuration of the update rate of position-related data to achieve a maximum position service latency of [insert value], as specified in 3GPP standards.
22261-j30;6.28.1	Description;Communication services supporting cyber-physical control applications need to be ultra-reliable, dependable with a high communication service availability, and often require low or (in some cases) very low end-to-end latency.;POSSIBLE;"The system shall provide an end-to-end latency that is sufficiently low to support cyber-physical control applications, where ""sufficiently low"" means either low (typically less than 100 ms) or very low (typically less than 20 ms), as required by the specific use case."
22261-j30;6.40.2	Requirements ;Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall be able to provide an indication about a planned change of bitrate, latency, or reliability for a QoS flow to an authorized 3rd party so that the 3rd party AI/ML application is able to adjust the application layer behaviour if time allows. The indication shall provide the anticipated time and location of the change, as well as the target QoS parameters.;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide an indication about a planned change of latency for a QoS flow to an authorized 3rd party with a minimum lead time that allows the 3rd party AI/ML application to adjust its behaviour, including the anticipated time and location of the change, as well as the target latency parameter.
22261-j30;6.40.2	Requirements ;Based on operator policy, 5G system shall be able to provide means to predict and expose predicted network condition changes (i.e. bitrate, latency, reliability) per UE, to an authorized third party.;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide a mechanism to predict and expose predicted latency conditions per User Equipment (UE) to an authorized third party based on operator policy.
22261-j30;6.41.2.10	Multicast/Broadcast;A hosting network shall support a mechanism to provide low latency signalling for efficient content delivery to many UEs.;POSSIBLE;The system shall support a one-way user plane latency of less than 10 ms, in order to facilitate efficient content delivery to multiple User Equipments (UEs).
22261-j30;6.42.2	Requirements;For immersive multi-modal VR applications, synchronization between different media components is critical in order to avoid having a negative impact on the user experience (i.e. viewers detecting lack of synchronization), particularly when the synchronization threshold between two or more modalities is less than the latency KPI for the application. Example synchronization thresholds [41] [42] [43] [44] are summarised in table 6.43.1-1.;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the synchronization threshold between different media components of immersive multi-modal VR applications does not exceed the latency Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for the application, to prevent a negative impact on the user experience due to lack of synchronization.
22261-j30;7.2.1	Overview;Several scenarios require the support of very low latency and very high communications service availability. Note that this implies a very high reliability. The overall service latency depends on the delay on the radio interface, transmission within the 5G system, transmission to a server which can be outside the 5G system, and data processing. Some of these factors depend directly on the 5G system itself, whereas for others the impact can be reduced by suitable interconnections between the 5G system and services or servers outside of the 5G system, for example, to allow local hosting of the services.;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide a maximum overall service latency that accounts for delays on the radio interface, transmission within the 5G system, transmission to external servers, and data processing, in order to support very low latency and high communications service availability.
22261-j30;7.2.2	Scenarios and KPIs ;-	Motion control – Conventional motion control is characterised by high requirements on the communications system regarding latency, reliability, and availability. Systems supporting motion control are usually deployed in geographically limited areas but can also be deployed in wider areas (e.g. city- or country-wide networks), access to them can be limited to authorized users, and they can be isolated from networks or network resources used by other cellular customers.;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide a round-trip latency of 20 ms or less for motion control applications, as required for real-time control and synchronization.
22261-j30;7.2.2	Scenarios and KPIs ;-	Automation for electricity distribution and smart grid (mainly medium and high voltage). Electricity distribution and smart grid are is characterized by high requirements on the communications service availability and security, as well as low latency in some cases. In contrast to the above use cases, electricity distribution and smart grid are deeply immersed into the public space. Since electricity distribution is an essential infrastructure, it is well served by network slices to provide service isolation and security, or by non-public networks.;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide a maximum one-way latency of 20 ms for mission-critical communications in automation for electricity distribution and smart grid applications, as specified in 3GPP TS 22.104 clause 6.1.4.
22261-j30;7.2.2	Scenarios and KPIs ;-	Rail communications (e.g. railway, rail-bound mass transit) have been using 3GPP based mobile communication (e.g. GSM-R) already for some time, while there is still a driver on-board of the train. The next step of the evolution will be providing fully automated train operation that requires highly reliable communication with moderate latencies but at very high speeds of up to 500 km/h.;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide latency suitable for highly reliable communication in rail communications, supporting speeds of up to 500 km/h.
22261-j30;7.2.3.2	Wireless road-side infrastructure backhaul;Road-side infrastructure such as traffic light controllers, roadside units, traffic monitoring in urban areas and along highways and streets is wirelessly connected to traffic control centres for management and control purposes.

22261-j30;7.6.1	AR/VR;Audio-visual interaction is characterised by a human being interacting with the environment or people, or controlling a UE, and relying on audio-visual feedback. In the use cases like VR and interactive conversation the latency requirements include the latencies at the application layer (e.g. codecs), which could be specified outside of 3GPP.;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that for audio-visual interaction use cases such as Virtual Reality and interactive conversations, the total latency including latencies at the application layer does not exceed the specified limits.
22261-j30;7.6.1	AR/VR;NOTE: 	The motion-to-photon latency is defined as the latency between the physical movement of a user's head and the updated picture in the VR headset. The motion-to-sound latency is the latency between the physical movement of a user's head and updated sound waves from a head mounted speaker reaching their ears.;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the one-way motion-to-photon latency does not exceed 20 ms, and the one-way motion-to-sound latency does not exceed 30 ms, to provide an acceptable virtual reality experience.

22261-j30;8.9	Data security and privacy;The 5G system shall support encryption for URLLC services within the requested end-to-end latency.;POSSIBLE;The system shall encrypt data for Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) services without exceeding the specified end-to-end latency of 1 ms as defined in 3GPP TS 38.913, clause 5.2.
22261-j30;D.1.0		General;In a closed-loop control application, the controller periodically submits instructions to a set of sensor/actuator devices, which return a response within a so-called cycle time. The messages, which are referred to as telegrams, are typically small (≤ 56 bytes). The cycle time can be as low as 2 ms, setting stringent end-to-end latency constraints on telegram forwarding (≤ 1 ms). Additional constraints on isochronous telegram delivery add tight constraints on the lateness (1 s), and the communication service has also to be highly available (99,9999%). ;POSSIBLE;The system shall forward telegrams with an end-to-end latency of no more than 1 ms.
22261-j30;D.1.0		General;A typical industrial closed-loop motion control application is based on individual control events. Each closed-loop control event consists of a downlink transaction followed by a synchronous uplink transaction, both of which are executed within a cycle time. Control events within a manufacturing unit might need to occur isochronously. Factory automation considers application layer transaction cycles between controller devices and sensor/actuator devices. Each transaction cycle consists of (1) a command sent by the controller to the sensor/actuator (downlink), (2) application-layer processing on the sensor/actuator device, and (3) a subsequent response by the sensor/actuator to the controller (uplink). Cycle time includes the entire transaction from the transmission of a command by the controller to the reception of a response by the controller. It includes all lower layer processes and latencies on the radio interface as well the application-layer processing time on the sensor/actuator.;POSSIBLE;The system shall support end-to-end latency of individual control events in industrial closed-loop motion control applications, where each event consists of downlink and uplink transactions executed within a cycle time that includes radio interface latencies and application-layer processing times.
22261-j30;D.2.0		General;"The related use cases require support of a large number of sensor devices per plant, as well as high communication service availability (99,99%). Furthermore, power consumption is relevant since some sensor devices are battery-powered with a targeted battery lifetime of several years (while providing measurement updates every few seconds). Range also becomes a critical factor due to the low transmit power levels of the sensors, the large size of the plant, and the high-reliability requirements on transport. End-to-end latency requirements typically range between 10 ms and 1 s. User-experienced data rates can be rather low since each transaction typically comprises less than 256 bytes. However, there has been a shift from field busses featuring somewhat modest data rates (~ 2 Mbit/s) to those with higher data rates (~ 10 Mbit/s) due to the increasing number of distributed applications and ""data-hungry"" applications. An example for the latter is the visual control of production processes. For this application, the user experienced data rate is typically around 10 Mbit/s and the transmitted packets are much larger than what was stated earlier.";POSSIBLE;The system shall provide end-to-end latency between 10 ms and 1 s for communication services supporting sensor devices in industrial plants.
22261-j30;D.2.0		General;The use of licensed spectrum could overcome the vulnerability to same-band interference and therefore enable higher reliability. Utilization of licensed spectrum can be confined to those events where high interference bursts in unlicensed bands jeopardizes communication service availability and end-to-end latency constraints. This allows sharing the licensed spectrum between process automation and conventional mobile services.;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that when utilizing licensed spectrum, the end-to-end latency does not exceed the maximum allowed value for the specific use case, as defined by 3GPP standards, in order to guarantee communication service availability.
22261-j30;D.3.0		General;Process automation has much in common with factory automation (see clause D.2). Instead of discrete products (cars, chocolate bars, etc.), process automation addresses the production of bulk products such as petrol and reactive gases. In contrast to factory automation, motion control is of limited or no importance. Typical end-to-end latencies are 50 ms. User-experienced data rates, communication service availability, and connection density vary noticeably between applications. Below, we describe one emerging use case (remote control via mobile computational units, clause D.3.1) and a contemporary use case (monitoring, clause D.3.2).;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide end-to-end latency of 50 ms or less for process automation applications.
22261-j30;D.4.1.0		Overview;"A use case that could also be realised in the future is fault isolation and system restoration (FISR). FISR automates the management of faults in the distribution grid. It supports the localization of the fault, the isolation of the fault, and the restoration of the power delivery. For this kind of automation, the pertinent sensors and actuators broadcast telegrams about their states (e.g., ""emergency closer idle"") and about actions (e.g., ""activating closer"") into the backhaul network. This information is used by the ring main units (RMUs) as input for their decision algorithms. We illustrate this use of automation telegrams for an automated FISR event in figure D.4.1.0-1. Let us assume the distribution lines are cut at the location indicated by the bolt of lightning in the figure. In that case, the RMUs between the bolt and the green load switch (open) will be without power. The RMUs next to the ""bolt"" automatically open their load switches after having sensed the loss of electric connectivity between them. They both broadcast these actions into the backhaul network. Typically, these telegrams are repeated many times while the time between adjacent telegrams increases exponentially. This communication patterns leads to sudden, distributed surges in the consumed communication bandwidth. After the RMUs next to the ""bolt"" have opened their switch, the RMU that so far has kept the power line ring open (green dot in figure D.4.1.0-1) closes the load switch. This event too is broadcasted into the backhaul network. The typical maximum end-to-end latency for this kind of broadcast is 25 ms with a peak experienced data rate of 10 Mbit/s. Note that the distribution system typically subscribes to telegrams from all RMUs in order to keep abreast with the happenings in the distribution grid. ";POSSIBLE;The system shall support an end-to-end latency for broadcasting automation telegrams related to Fault Isolation and System Restoration (FISR) events of no more than 25 ms.

22261-j30;D.5.0 	General;RSUs are connected to the traffic control centre for management and control purposes. They broadcast, e.g., traffic light information (RSU  vehicle) and traffic information from the traffic-control centre (TCC) via the RSU to the vehicles (TCC  RSU  vehicle). RSUs also collect vehicle probe data for the traffic control centre (vehicle  RSU  TCC). For reliable distribution of data, low-latency and high-capacity connections between RSUs (e.g. traffic lights, traffic signs, etc.) and the TCC are required. This type of application comes with rather tight end-to-end latency requirements for the communication service between RSU and TCC (10 ms), since relayed data needs to be processed in the TCC and, if needed, the results are forwarded to neighbouring RSUs. Also, the availability of the communication service has to be very high (99,9999%) in order to compete with existing wired technology and in order to justify the costly deployment and maintenance of RSUs. Furthermore, due to considerably large aggregation areas (see clause D.5.1), considerable amounts of data need to be backhauled to the TCC (up to 10 Mbit/s per RSU).;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide an end-to-end latency of 10 ms or less for communication services between Roadside Units (RSUs) and the Traffic Control Centre (TCC).
22261-j30;F.1	QoS monitoring for assurance;The start time and the duration of the QoS monitoring is specified in the parameter observation time interval, which is exchanged between the customer, for instance an application consuming a communication service, and the provider (for instance a private 5G network providing a communication service). The observation time interval is the time interval during which a series of measurements is conducted. In the context of QoS monitoring, these are the measurements necessary for assessing the QoS of communication services, for instance the measurement of end-to-end latencies.;POSSIBLE;The system shall measure and report end-to-end latency within the observation time interval specified in the parameter exchanged between the customer and provider.

22263;4.2.1	System latency;The overall system latency has an important impact on the applications that this specification targets. In video production, overall system latency is referred to as imaging system latency and has an impact on the timing of synchronized cameras. For audio applications, overall system latency is referred to as mouth to ear latency and it is critical to maintain lip sync and avoid a performer to be put off by hearing their own echo. Finally, in medical applications the system latency impairs the achievable precision at a given gesture speed as it translates the time needed to traverse the whole imaging system into a geometrical error of the instruments position. ;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide an overall system latency that allows for accurate lip sync and synchronization between audio and video streams, precise instrument positioning in medical applications, and timely camera synchronization in video production use cases.
22263;4.3	AV production ;The performance aspects that are covered in this document also target the latency that these services experience. Since these applications involve physical feedback on performances that are happening live, the latency requirements are very strict.

22281;5.1.1.3.1	Description;Although MCVideo requires low latency video streams not all video streams need to comply with the same low latency. There are some situations where the latency is less important but it is very important to capture what is visible in front of the camera at the precise time. These different requirements do not necessarily relate to the level of situational Emergency and so there is a difference in a MCVideo service between Emergency and urgency.;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide two distinct latency modes for MCVideo services: one for low-latency video streams where timely capture of real-time events is critical, and another for situations where latency is less important but accurate synchronization with the camera's field of view is still required.

On one hand, a Service Hosting Environment located inside of operator's network can offer Hosted Services closer to the end user to meet localization requirement like low latency, low bandwidth pressure. These Hosted Services contain applications provided by operators and/or trusted 3rd parties. On the other hand, user plane paths can be selected or changed to improve the user experience or reduce the bandwidth pressure, when a UE or application changes location during an active communication.;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide a Service Hosting Environment that enables Hosted Services with a latency of less than 10 ms for applications requiring low latency, as measured from the User Equipment (UE) to the service hosting environment.

22856-j00;5.9.1 	Description;The distance between the users, e.g., the distance between USA and China is around 11640 Km, determines minimum communication latency, e.g., 11640/c = 38 msec. This latency might also be higher due to different causes such as, e.g., hardware processing. This latency might also be variable due to multiple reasons, such as, e.g., congestion or delays introduced by (variable processing time of) hardware components such as sensors or rendering devices. Since this value maybe too high and variable for a truly immersive joint location agnostic metaverse service experience, each of the deployed avatars includes one or more predictive models of the person it represents and that allow rendering in the local edge server a synchronized predicted (current) digital representation (i.e. avatar) of the remote users. Similar techniques have been proposed for example in [28]. ;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the end-to-end latency for real-time communication between users in a metaverse service does not exceed 38 milliseconds, taking into account the geographical distance between them and potential additional delays introduced by hardware processing or network congestion.
22856-j00;5.9.1 	Description;Figure 5.9.1-1 shows an exemplary scenario in which a MECS at location 3 (USA) runs the predictive models of remote users (Yong and Lukas) and takes as input the received sensed data from all users (Yong, Lukas, and Bob) as well as the current end-to-end communication parameters (e.g., latency) and generates a synchronized predicted (current) avatar digital representation (i.e. avatar) of the users to be rendered in local rendering devices of Bob. A particular example of such scenario might be about gaming: Yong, Lukas, and Bob are playing baseball in an immersive mobile metaverse activity , and it is Yong’s turn to hit the ball that is going to be thrown by Lukas. If Yong hits the ball, then Bob can continue running since Yong and Bob are playing in the same team. In this example, the digital representation (e.g. avatar) predictive models of Lukas and Yong (deployed at the MECS close to Bob) will allow creating a combined synchronized prediction at Location 3 of Lukas throwing the ball and Yong reacting to the ball and hitting the ball so that Bob can start running without delays and can enjoy a great immersive mobile metaverse experience. ;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the latency between the MECS receiving sensed data from users and generating the synchronized predicted avatar digital representation is low enough to allow for real-time rendering of the avatars in local rendering devices, enabling an immersive mobile metaverse experience with minimal delays.

Mobile metaverse services enabled by tactile sensors along with video and audio media can provide a rich and successful experience to both physician and patient. The ability to perform mobile metaverse service consultation without the need for the doctors and patient to be physically co-located is an extremely efficient prospect. Doctors can potentially use mobile metaverse services to examine and interact with representations of aspects and views of the patient, and benefit from a plethora of medical advice database as shown in Figure-5.10.1-1.c. 5G communication is one the key factors to enable mobile metaverse service based physician consolation. Doctors and patients both need high throughput, ultra-reliable and low latency 5G communication for these services to succeed.

22856-j00;5.12.1	Description;For smooth experience, the motion-to-photon latency should be less than 20ms [48]. The motion-to-photon latency requires that the latency between the moment that players do one movement and the corresponding new videos shown in VR glasses and tactile from vibrating backpacks or haptic gloves should be less than 20ms. As the asynchrony between different modalities increases, users’ experience will decrease because uses are able to detect asynchronies. Therefore, the synchronisation among audio, visual and tactile is also very important. The synchronisation thresholds regarding audio, visual and tactile modalities measured by Hirsh and Sherrick are described as follows [49]. The obtained results vary, depending on the kind of stimuli, biasing effects of stimulus range, the psychometric methods employed, etc.;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the motion-to-photon latency between user movement and corresponding visual, audio, or tactile feedback is less than 20ms to maintain a smooth experience for users of VR glasses, vibrating backpacks, or haptic gloves.

For example, when a virtual leaf falls on the hand of Alice’s virtual human, Alice should see the leaf fall on her hand and sense the presence of a leaf at the same time. It means that the tactile impression from haptic gloves should come within 30ms after the video in VR glasses (assuming the video media precedes the haptic media.) Or, the video in VR glasses should come within 20ms if the tactile impression resulting from tactile media presented by the haptic gloves, if the tactile media precedes the video media.;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that when a virtual object interacts with Alice's virtual human, the latency between the visual rendering of the interaction and the corresponding haptic feedback is within 30ms if the video media precedes the haptic media, or within 20ms if the tactile media precedes the video media.

22856-j00;5.23.1	Description;In mobile metaverse, spatial-temporal consistency for single user could mean, for example, dropping a virtual pen and seeing this pen fall subsequently. While for multiple players, this consistency could mean, for example, that one person cuts down a tree and other people see the tree falling down. This user experience requires the motion-to-photon latency in the range of 7 ms to 15ms [5] at least for a single user viewing the consequence of her own actions. Immersive VR requires the delivery of massive amount of data (in the order of Gigabyte) at ultra-low latency (less than 20 ms) [54].;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide motion-to-photon latency in the range of 7 ms to 15ms for a single user viewing the consequence of her own actions in mobile metaverse applications.
22856-j00;5.23.2	Pre-conditions;There are about 12,000 players sign up for a popular game and appear simultaneously in a specific setting, such as Eve Online in 2021. Due to the limitations of the existing server processing, it is not possible to support such a large number of high concurrency, so the network and application server need to cooperate to support the distribution of visitors to other servers while ensuring low latency requirement by XR applications.;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the latency for XR applications does not exceed the threshold defined in 3GPP standards (e.g., 5G NR), even when distributing a large number of concurrent users (up to 12,000) across multiple servers.
22856-j00;5.23.3	Service Flows;3. According to the cooperation agreement with application, 5G network will expose information to service providers, including the physical location and network delay of specific terminals or a group of terminals. The network delay includes the delay inside 5G system (UE to PSA UPF) and the latency information between PSA UPF and some potential servers.;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide an interface for exposing network delay information to service providers, including the one-way latency between UE and PSA UPF and the round-trip latency between PSA UPF and external servers.

22856-j00;5.25.1	Description;In case of converged or hybrid network architecture, a single mobile metaverse user can access mobile metaverse services via 5GS using both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses simultaneously. In such scenario, the metaverse traffic would need to be synchronized as it may be subject to varying latencies when routed over both 3GPP and non-3GPP access. Alternatively, a single mobile metaverse service can be accessed by multiple users across multiple access networks from a network operator.;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the latency difference between 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses for a single mobile metaverse user does not exceed the maximum allowed value as specified in 3GPP standards, to prevent desynchronization of metaverse traffic.

22865-j00;5.15.3	Service Flows;UAM vehicle B keeps gathering the movement information of vehicle A even after it moves out of Ter-OP network coverage. Since the information exchange between UAM vehicles should be performed in real time (with very low latency), the vehicles communicate with each other via satellite directly without going through the ground network.;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide end-to-end latency of less than 20 ms for direct satellite communication between UAM vehicles to enable real-time information exchange.
22876-j00;5.1.3	Service Flows;The E2E service latency (including image recognition latency and intermediate data transmission latency) is 1 second. ;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the end-to-end (E2E) service latency, encompassing both image recognition processing time and intermediate data transmission delay, does not exceed 1 second.
22876-j00;5.1.3	Service Flows;Then UE-A established the sidelink (direct device connection) to UE-B. During the sidelink establishment, the UE-B also gets the information of the total service latency (including the image recognition latency and intermediate data transmission latency) and the processing time consumed by UE-A for computing layer 1-4.;POSSIBLE;The system shall provide the total service latency and processing time consumed by UE-A to UE-B within the sidelink establishment procedure, as specified in 3GPP standards.
22876-j00;5.1.3	Service Flows;	Since the UE-B has acquired the E2E service latency and the processing time consumed by UE-A, and also it knows its own processing time for computing layer 5-15, the UE-B can determine the QoS parameters applied to both Uu and Sidelink while keeping the E2E service latency same as the E2E service latency described in step-1. ;POSSIBLE;The system shall calculate and apply the QoS parameters for both Uu and Sidelink interfaces such that the end-to-end (E2E) service latency is maintained within the target value specified in step-1, taking into account the processing times of UE-A and UE-B.

22876-j00;5.2.1	Description;The robot control is not executed on a distant server in the cloud because reliability and confidentiality were not ensured at a sufficient level. Furthermore, as stated in [14], the overall end-to-end latency is not always guaranteed which can cause production loss. Communications between robots can rely on private wireless networks in the factory that enable expected QoS (reliability, throughput, and latency) as well as confidentiality.;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure an end-to-end latency for robot control communications that meets the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements to prevent production loss, as specified by 3GPP standards for private wireless networks in a factory setting.
22876-j00;5.2.1	Description;The autonomous robot’s skills rely on several AI/ML models running on the robot itself which has the inconvenience that the mobile robot’s battery drain quicker. To overcome this issue, when the battery level reaches a certain value, a part of the AI/ML model can be transferred to a service hosting environment and / or to another robot by splitting the AI/ML model as defined in [20]. The split model approach of [20] is applicable to a UE-to-UE (or robot-to-robot) architecture. Thus, the AI/ML model M is split and shared between (e.g.) 2 robots, say an assisted robot and an assistant robot. Intermediate data generated by the assisted robot are transferred to the assisting robot which finalizes the inference and transmits the results back to the assisted robot. This intermediate data transfer must be extremely efficient in terms of latency and throughput. When many models are at stake, the split model method is an additional challenge for the 5GS in terms of throughput, latency and synchronization.;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that the round-trip time (RTT) for transferring intermediate data between robots does not exceed 10 ms as specified in 3GPP TS 22.261 for Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) use cases.

22882-j00;5.1.1	Description;There is an important type of traffic where energy efficiency policy, for example a maximum amount of energy to be utilized could be applied without conflict with this guidance. Best effort traffic is a type of traffic that is provided as a service to customers everything else being equal. Of course, security, privacy and complexity principles will not be sacrificed, but there is no conflict between a service policy that constrains performance (e.g. latency, throughput, even availability) on the basis of energy consumption and a best effort service, since there are no guarantees in the case of best effort traffic. We can say that best effort traffic is not associated with QoS policy service performance level criteria.;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that for best effort traffic, latency constraints based on energy efficiency policies do not conflict with the provision of a best effort service to customers.

These are integrated into vehicles, palettes, facilities, etc. Essentially, IoT terminals enable remote tracking and monitoring functions. The information gathered is relevant, but not constrained with respect to latency. In fact, eventual delivery (e.g. after hours or even a full day) of communication is entirely acceptable for L. The MNO M offers a 'green service' which limits the rate of energy utilized for communication over a particular time interval (e.g. per day) and this service is appropriate for L, whose overall corporate goals are also served by 'green service,' as they strive to operate with energy efficiency.;POSSIBLE;The system shall support a maximum latency of up to several hours or even a full day for the transmission of tracking and monitoring data from IoT terminals to the logistics company's systems.
22882-j00;5.1.3	Service flows;"4.	The policy indicates that latency can be traded off with energy consumption for service to L; the communication service is delay tolerant in this condition. As the energy consumption rate has exceeded the maximum, the latency is increased to enforce this policy. In effect, L's fleet receives very limited service, with high latency, even for a limited period of time, no service at all.";POSSIBLE;The system shall increase latency for communication services to user equipment (UE) in low-power mode when energy consumption exceeds the maximum allowed rate, as specified in 3GPP standards.
22882-j00;5.2.1	Description;Industrial campuses are very typical scenarios of edge computing and local traffic offload. Dedicated network facilities are usually deployed near the campus for lower latency and local data protection. This brings a problem that these network facilities are used only for the campus, so while the manufacturing load is light or during vacation, these network facilities will be in very light load or even no load. Under this scenario, the energy consumption of these network facilities will be unnecessary.;POSSIBLE;The system shall ensure that latency-critical applications operating on industrial campuses with dedicated edge computing and local traffic offload have a maximum one-way radio access network latency of 10 ms for at least 95% of the packets during periods of both high and low manufacturing load, in accordance with 3GPP TS 22.261.
22882-j00;5.2.2	Pre-conditions;Factory F, a smart manufacturing factory locates in a remote area outside the city. Factory F requires low latency in AGV transporting services and local data processing using computing vision to support image comparison for fault detection in circuit boards. Factory F has an agreement with Operator T on the communication service with certain SLA. As the manufacturing activity is not consistent, Operator T provides a replaceable SLA which can be used during off-peak time.

22882-j00;5.14.1	Description;Up until now usually a system is designed to finish compute tasks as soon as possible (high throughput) and indicate results to the requester as soon as possible (low latency). However, some compute tasks have flexibility in both when and where they are executed, i.e., such type of workload could be executed in any computing node and tolerate some delays if the workload gets completed within certain given deadline. For example, some of AI/ML training, simulation, and video processing tasks might not require a quick response, which would allow flexibility to delay the execution of the related workloads in a computing node until, e.g., the utilized energy is deemed satisfactory in terms of GHG emissions. Such flexibility further allows to route workloads to a computing node using the (most) sustainable energy sources at that moment. As part of service, 3GPP system is able to execute compute tasks in a sustainable way by leveraging such flexibility.;POSSIBLE;The system shall be capable of executing compute tasks within a specified deadline, allowing for flexibility in when and where they are executed, in order to optimize energy sustainability while meeting the required latency constraints as defined in 3GPP standards.
