22071;"Annex A (informative):
USA FCC Wireless E911 Rules";Location Delivery Latency (Time to First Fix) is set at a maximum of 30 seconds from the time the user initiates an emergency service call to the time it is available at the location information center.;POSSIBLE
22101;7.2	Multimedia;"Conversational services are real time (no store and forward), usually bi-directional where low end to end delays (< 100 ms) and a high degree of synchronisation between media components (implying low delay variation) are required. Video telephony and video conferencing are typical conversational services.""";POSSIBLE
22101;29.2	Exposed Services and capabilities;-	The 3GPP Core Network shall enable a 3rd party service provider to request setting up data sessions with specified QoS (e.g. low latency or jitter) and priority handling to a UE that is served by the 3rd party service provider.;POSSIBLE
22104-j00;4.3	Communication attributes;Periodicity means that a transmission interval is repeated. For example, a transmission occurs every 15 ms. Reasons for a periodical transmission can be the periodic update of a position or the repeated monitoring of a characteristic parameter. Most periodic intervals in communication for automation are rather short. The transmission is started once and continuous unless a stop command is provided.;POSSIBLE
22104-j00;4.3	Communication attributes;Determinism refers to whether the delay between transmission of a message and receipt of the message at the destination address is stable (within bounds). Usually, communication is called deterministic if it is bounded by a given threshold for the latency/transmission time. In case of a periodic transmission, the variation of the interval is bounded.;POSSIBLE
22104-j00;5.1	Overview;Communication service availability is considered an important service performance requirement for cyber-physical applications, especially for applications with deterministic traffic. The communication service availability depends on the latency and reliability (in the context of network layer packet transmissions, as defined in TS 22.261 [2]) of the logical communication link, as well as the survival time of the cyber-physical application (see Annex C.3 for further details on these relations).;POSSIBLE
22104-j00;5.1	Overview;High accuracy positioning is becoming essential for Factories of the Future. The reason for this is that tracking of mobile devices as well as mobile assets is becoming increasingly important in improving processes and increasing flexibility in industrial environments, Clause 5.7 provides positioning requirements for horizontal and vertical accuracy, availability, heading, latency and UE speed in an industrial use case scenario.;POSSIBLE
22104-j00;5.6C.2	Requirements;The 5G system shall support an end-to-end latency of less than 5 ms or 10 ms, as requested by the UE initiating the communication.;POSSIBLE
22104-j00;5.6C.2	Requirements;The 5G system shall support communication channel symmetry in terms of end-to-end latency (latency from UE1 to UE2, and end-to-end latency from UE2 to UE1), with an asymmetry of < 2ms. ;POSSIBLE
22104-j00;A.2.2.3	Mobile robots;–	AGV route control and emergency safety related time critical latency and response can be achieved with an edge cloud where the edge infrastructure is located close to the AGVs;POSSIBLE
22104-j00;A.2.2.5	Cooperative carrying;The communication between the collaborating mobile robots / AGVs requires high communication service availability and ultra-low latency. The exchange of control commands and control feedback is done with periodic deterministic communication and using time-sensitive networking.;POSSIBLE
22104-j00;A.2.3.1	Closed-loop control;In the closed-loop control use case for process automation, several sensors are installed in a plant and each sensor performs continuous measurements. The measurement data are transported to a controller, which takes decision to set actuators. The latency and determinism in this use case are crucial. This use case has very stringent requirements in terms of latency and service availability. The required service area is usually bigger than for motion control use cases. Interaction with the public network (e.g., service continuity, roaming) is not required.;POSSIBLE
22104-j00;A.2.3.4	Inspection in production systems;In another case, using telemetry data as input, the digital twin model’s output may be fed to an AR server for sending low latency AR streams toward the manual operator in the factory production area. At the same time, it can further be utilized as input by an AI/ML model.  A process control function can compare the machine data (example:position, rotation level, speed, sensor data, high-speed photography etc.) and perhaps a high-resolution video from the manufacturing line and  if necessary, it can send commands for corrective measure. In this example, the process control functions reside at the edge infrastructure and the inspection related corrective input is sent back to the production system control function.;POSSIBLE
22104-j00;A.2.4.1	Mobile control panels;Due to the criticality of these safety functions, safety control panels currently have mostly a wire-bound connection to the equipment they control. In consequence, there tend to be many such panels for the many machines and production units that typically can be found in a factory. With an ultra-reliable low-latency wireless link, it would be possible to connect such mobile control panels with safety functions wirelessly. This would lead to a higher usability and would allow for the flexible and easy re-use of panels for controlling different machines. ;POSSIBLE
22104-j00;A.2.4.1	Mobile control panels;The cycle times of the control application depends on the process/machinery/equipment whose safety has to be ensured. For a fast-moving robot, for example, end-to-end latencies are lower than for slowly moving linear actuators. ;POSSIBLE
22104-j00;A.2.4.1A	Mobile operation panels;Operation and monitoring of machines, mobile robots, or production units via a mobile operation panel provides higher flexibility and comfort for human operators. A single mobile operation panel can be used to manage more than one production system due to its mobility in the factory. The mobile operation panel provides relevant information for configuration, control of industrial machines as well as monitoring of relevant data generated during the construction of a product. The monitoring data is generally considered to be less time-critical subsequently requiring non-real-time communication. On the other hand, the mobile operation panel supports safety-critical functions such as emergency stops or enabling or changing the position of robots and other machines. These functions are generally considered to have strict ultra-low latencies and reliable transmission requirements that must follow strict safety standards making them time-critical (real-time communication).;POSSIBLE
22104-j00;A.4.4.1	Distributed automated switching for isolation and service restoration;The system is designed for using fully distributed, independent automated devices. The logic resides in each individual feeder automation controller located at the poles in the feeder level. Each feeder section has a controller device. Using peer-to-peer communication among the controller devices, the system operates autonomously without the need of a regional controller or control centre. However, all self-healing steps carried out will be reported immediately to the control centre to keep the grid status up to date. The controllers conduct self-healing of the distribution line in typically 500 ms by isolating the faults.;POSSIBLE
22104-j00;A.4.4.1	Distributed automated switching for isolation and service restoration;The service bit rate per controller is low in steady state, but GOOSE bursts with high service bit rate do occur, especially during fault situations. GOOSE messages are sent by several or all controller units of the feeder nearly at the same point in time during the fault location, isolation and service restoration procedure with a low end-to-end latency. ;POSSIBLE
22104-j00;A.4.4.4	High-speed current differential protection;"High-speed current differential protection, which is required for sub-millisecond fault detection, is another typical use case of power distribution automation. The approach utilises differential current measurements to significantly reduce fault detection time. The protection relays exchange the current samples via the 5G system. Each relay then compares the sent and received samples to determine if a fault has occurred in a protected area. This is done in order to identify and isolate a fault in the grid. The sampling rate varies and is dependent on the algorithms designed by the manufacturers. A protection relay collects the current samples (with the typical message size of up to 245 bytes) at a frequency of 600 Hz, 1200 Hz, 1600 Hz, or 3000 Hz. The exchange of measurement samples is done in a strictly cyclic and deterministic manner. With the sampling rate of 600 Hz, the transfer interval is 1.7 ms and the required bandwidth 1.2 Mbit/s; for 1200 Hz, the transfer interval is 0.83 ms and the required bandwidth 2.4 Mbit/s. The maximum allowed end-to-end delay between two protection relays is between 5 ms and 10 ms, depending on the voltage (see  IEC 61850-90-1 for more details [28]). For some legacy systems, the latency usually is set to 15 ms. The associated KPIs are provided in Table A.4.4.4-1.";POSSIBLE
22104-j00;A.4.9	Distributed energy resources and micro-grids;"When it comes to communications architecture, IEC 61850 is a widely used standard for automation and equipment of power utilities and DER, specifically for defining protocols for IEDs (Intelligent electronic devices) at electrical substations The IEC 61850 standard specifies the timing constraints for messages typically used in substations. GOOSE (Generic Object Oriented Substation Events) and SV (Sampled Values) messages are assumed as time critical messages. They have the tightest deadlines (maximum allowed transfer time) among all IEC 61850 messages, corresponding to 3 ms. While GOOSE is typically used for transfering information related to monitoring and control functions (circuit breaker status etc.), SV is used for transfering measurement samples of current and voltage signals. The SV protocol works on a periodic information transmission model, sending messages at a fixed rate. For protection purposes, the default rate is 4000 or 4800 messages per second for 50 and 60 Hz power systems, respectively. On the other hand, the GOOSE protocol operates in a sporadic information transmission model, where a continuous flow of data is maintained to increase communication reliability. The typical sizes of GOOSE and SV messages are160 and 140 bytes, respectively. GOOSE messages are transmitted in two different modes: (1) safe operation: 1 message per second (service bit rate = 1.28 kbit/s); (2) emergency operation: 32 messages per second (service bit rate = 41.0 kbit/s). SV messages are transmitted at much higher rate, namely 4800 messages per second (service bit rate = 5.4 Mbit/s). The associated KPIs are provided in Table A.4.9-1.";POSSIBLE
22104-j00;A.6.2	Robotic Aided Surgery;Periodic communication for the support of cooperative robotic motion control and haptic feedback in case of telesurgery. In this case, the surgeon console and the robot are not collocated and communicate with each other through a connection established over a PLMN possibly spanning an entire country. Relaxed requirements imply that much less complex surgical procedures are achievable in use case 2 than in use case 1. It shall be noted that this use case also involves more experienced and trained surgeons, who can cope with longer latencies in the communication system.;POSSIBLE
22104-j00;C.4.1	Overview;"There are several time parameters in dependability assessment. A required value is specified for every time parameter. This value can be a maximum, mean, modal, minimum etc. Typically, there is a deviation from the desired value to the actual value. Jitter is often used to characterise this variation. Since jitter generally is used for characterising the behaviour of a measured parameter, for instance the scatter of measured end-to-end latencies (""the world as it is""), it can be quite confusing to use it for formulating service performance requirements (""the world as we want it to be""). What is needed is a concept and related parameters that allow for formulating and talking about the end-to-end latency requirements in Clause 5 and Annex A.";POSSIBLE
22104-j00;C.4.2	Network latency requirement formulated by use of timeliness;In 5G networks, the end-to-end latency KPI is a critical KPI in order to ensure that the network can deliver the packet within a time limit specified by an application: not too early and not too late. ;POSSIBLE
22104-j00;C.4.2	Network latency requirement formulated by use of timeliness;In cyber-physical automation, the arrival time of a specific packet should be strictly inside a prescribed time window. In other words, a strict time boundary applies: [minimum end-to-end latency, maximum end-to-end latency]. Otherwise, the transmission is erroneous. Although most use cases that require timely delivery only specify the maximum end-to-end latency, the minimum latency is also sometimes prescribed. In the latter case, a communication error occurs if the packet is delivered earlier than the minimum end-to-end latency. An example for a related application is putting labels at a specific location on moving objects, and the arrival of a message is interpreted as a trigger for this action. In other words, the application does not keep its own time, but interprets the message arrival as clock signal. Maximum and minimum end-to-end latency alone do not disclose which value is preferred, i.e. target value. The next three subclauses introduce concepts help with relating maximum end-to-end latency, minimum end-to-end latency, and target vale to each other. ;POSSIBLE
22104-j00;C.4.3	Timeliness;"A message reception is considered in time, if it is received within the timeliness interval. If it is received outside the timeliness interval, the message reception is considered invalid. This is related to the communication error ""unacceptable deviation from target end-to-end latency"" (see Subclause B.6). In other words, maximum end-to-end latency = tUB and minimum end-to-end latency = tLB.";POSSIBLE
22104-j00;C.4.7	Conclusion;Minimum end-to-end latency = target end-to-end latency – maximum earliness.;POSSIBLE
22104-j00;E.2	Multiple source wireless studio;This use case will deploy a multiple camera studio of approximately 1,000 m2 (~5 cameras) where wired and wireless functionalities currently provided by traditional infrastructure technologies are likely to be deployed using a standalone non-public network. A combination of IP enabled wired and wireless cameras working at both HD and UHD resolutions will be deployed in a studio. Associated equipment such as video monitors, prompting systems, camera control will be provided over the 5G network. Camera timing and synchronisation will be provided over the 5G system. As well as video, audio will be sourced from both wired and wireless microphones incl. control/monitoring and combined with the video to produce high quality synchronised AV content. 5G will also be deployed to control lighting and camera robotics. Talkback intercom systems will be deployed using low latency multicast links.;POSSIBLE
22104-j00;E.2	Multiple source wireless studio;Other aspects of this workflow may also include robotic control where both the physical position (height, direction and tilt) and the technical control (focus, zoom, iris, colour) of a device of a camera, microphone or light may be controlled remotely. In this instance round trip latency of < 20ms is required in order for an operator to see a move reflected at his control position as it is made.;POSSIBLE
22104-j00;E.3	Timing use in AV production applications;-	To maintain synchronisation between devices so that electronic shutters on cameras operate at the same time and frequency and that when cutting between any two cameras pointed at the same source no discernible jumps can be seen. This requires accuracy within the frame boundary of a given video signal. A single frame of video at 120 Hz would require a clock accurate to within 8 ms. ;POSSIBLE
22104-j00;"Annex F (informative):
Relation of reliability and communication service availability";This scenario describes unicast communication of evenly interspersed packets from application A to B. The packets are handed over at the communication service interface A from the application to the communication network, and the packets are then transmitted to the end node B. However, only every second packet is actually successfully handed over to end node A and then transmitted to end node B. Thus, only half of the packets arrive at application B. Note though that the reliability of the mobile network is 100%, since all packets transmitted by end node A are delivered to end node B within the time constraint required by the targeted service. However, depending on the agreed QoS, the communication service availability can be of the same value as the reliability or much lower. For instance, if the agreed survival time is equal to or larger than the end-to-end latency, reliability and communication service availability are equal. However, if the survival time is smaller, the reliability is two times the communication service availability. ;POSSIBLE
22104-j00;"Annex F (informative):
Relation of reliability and communication service availability";Note that the shortest time interval over which the communication service availability should be calculated is the sum of maximum allowed end-to-end latency and survival time.;POSSIBLE
22125;4.2	C2 Communication;There are four control modes considered in the C2 communication for the UAV operation that are with different requirements, e.g. on message intervals, sizes, and end to end latencies, etc., including steer to waypoints, direct stick steering, automatic flight by UTM and approaching autonomous navigation infrastructure. ;POSSIBLE

22125[1];7.4	Other requirements ;[R-7.4-001] The 5G system shall support a mechanism to switch between C2 communication modes for UAS operation, e.g. from indirect C2 communication to direct C2 communication, and ensure the disconnect time is below the latency requirements.;POSSIBLE
22156;5.1.1.2	Requirements;[R-5.1.1-003] Subject to operator policy, regulatory requirements and user consent, the 5G system (including IMS) shall be able to expose network performance information (e.g., observed or predicted bitrate, latency or packet loss) related to one or more users to an authorized third party metaverse application.;POSSIBLE
22156;5.1.1.2	Requirements;[R-5.1.1-008] The 5G system shall provide a means to maintain consistent user experience, for a given UE, when XR media from different mobile metaverse services have different communication performance, e.g., resolution, latency or packet loss.;POSSIBLE
22156;5.2.2.1	Description;The 5G system further supports predictive digital representation models in that it enables presentation of avatar media to users based upon timing and other information, so that information can be extrapolated or inferred even if it is not yet available from the network. Correction of these predictions is possible over time, as new information becomes available, e.g., from the real world.  The 5G system can in this way enable the user experience of synchronized mobile metaverse services even where communication latencies (e.g., due to distance between users) do not permit this.  ;POSSIBLE
22156;5.2.2.2	Requirements;[R-5.2.2-008] The 5G system (including IMS) shall support compensating for the end-to-end communication latency between the users and/or objects involved in a multimedia conversational communication prior/during rendering the digital representation (e.g., avatar) of the users and/or objects involved (e.g., by using a predictive digital representation model).;POSSIBLE
22179-j00;4.3	Overview of MCPTT Group affiliation, call and transmission;"Every time a PTT request is granted a user can start an MCPTT transmission or ""talk burst"". An MCPTT Group Call consists of one or more MCPTT transmissions. Whether two consecutive transmissions from same or different users are part of the same call, or the second transmission starts a new call, depends on the configurable maximum length of the inactivity period between the consecutive MCPTT transmissions. This inactivity period can be seen as a Hang Time that starts at the end of the preceding transmission. While this timer is running, the resources associated with the call stay assigned to the call (except in case of pre-emption), which could reduce the latency of future floor requests for this group versus groups who are not involved in a call. When a new transmission starts during the inactivity period, the timer is stopped, reset and restarted again at the end of that transmission.";POSSIBLE
22179-j00;6.15.3.2 	Requirements;[R-6.15.3.2-002] The MCPTT Service shall provide the MCPTT Access time and Mouth-to-ear latency specified in this subclause to all MCPTT Users related to an MCPTT call regardless of call type (e.g., group, Private Call), group size and/or user density.;POSSIBLE
22179-j00;6.15.3.2 	Requirements;[R-6.15.3.2-012a] For group and private calls where the call is already established, the MCPTT Service shall provide an MCPTT Access time (KPI 1) less than 300 ms for 95% of all MCPTT PTT Requests.;POSSIBLE
22179-j00;6.15.3.2 	Requirements;[R-6.15.3.2-015] The MCPTT Service shall provide a Mouth-to-ear latency (KPI 3) that is less than 300 ms for 95% of all voice bursts.;POSSIBLE
22179-j00;7.11.1.1	General overview;The Mouth-to-ear latency (KPI 3) is the time between an utterance by the transmitting user, and the playback of the utterance at the receiving user's speaker. Figure 7.11.1.1.1 illustrates the MCPTT Access time and Mouth-to-ear latency.;POSSIBLE
22186;5.5	Requirements to support Remote Driving;[R.5.6-004]	The 3GPP system shall be able to support an efficient and secure mechanism to gather information (e.g. location information, reliability information, timing information, latency information, velocity information), in order to generate information about quality of service in a resource efficient way.;POSSIBLE
22186[1];5.5	Requirements to support Remote Driving;[R.5.6-004]	The 3GPP system shall be able to support an efficient and secure mechanism to gather information (e.g. location information, reliability information, timing information, latency information, velocity information), in order to generate information about quality of service in a resource efficient way.;POSSIBLE
22261-j30;4	Overview;Unlike previous 3GPP systems that attempted to provide a 'one size fits all' system, the 5G system is expected to be able to provide optimized support for a variety of different services, different traffic loads, and different end user communities. Various industry white papers, most notably, the NGMN 5G White Paper [2], describe a multi-faceted 5G system capable of simultaneously supporting multiple combinations of reliability, latency, throughput, positioning, and availability. This technology revolution is achievable with the introduction of new technologies, both in access and the core, such as flexible, scalable assignment of network resources. In addition to increased flexibility and optimization, a 5G system needs to support stringent KPIs for latency, reliability, throughput, etc. Enhancements in the radio interface contribute to meeting these KPIs as do enhancements in the core network, such as network slicing, in-network caching and hosting services closer to the end points.;POSSIBLE
22261-j30;4	Overview;Mobile Broadband (MBB) enhancements aim to meet a number of new KPIs. These pertain to high data rates, high user density, high user mobility, highly variable data rates, deployment, and coverage. High data rates are driven by the increasing use of data for services such as streaming (e.g. video, music, and user generated content), interactive services (e.g. AR), and IoT. These services come with stringent requirements for user experienced data rates as well as associated requirements for latency to meet service requirements. Additionally, increased coverage in densely populated areas such as sports arenas, urban areas, and transportation hubs has become essential for pedestrians and users in urban vehicles. New KPIs on traffic and connection density enable both the transport of high volumes of data traffic per area (traffic density) and transport of data for a high number of connections (e.g. UE density or connection density). Many UEs are expected to support a variety of services which exchange either a very large (e.g. streaming video) or very small (e.g. data burst) amount of data. The 5G system will handle this variability in a resource efficient manner. All of these cases introduce new deployment requirements for indoor and outdoor, local area connectivity, high user density, wide area connectivity, and UEs travelling at high speeds.;POSSIBLE
22261-j30;4	Overview;Another aspect of 5G KPIs includes requirements for various combinations of latency and reliability, as well as higher accuracy for positioning. These KPIs are driven by support for both commercial and public safety services. On the commercial side, industrial control, industrial automation, UAV control, and AR are examples of those services. Services such as UAV control will require more precise positioning information that includes altitude, speed, and direction, in addition to horizontal coordinates.;POSSIBLE
22261-j30;6.4.1	Description;Cloud applications like cloud robotics perform computation in the network rather than in a UE, which requires the system to have high data rate in the uplink and very low round trip latency. Supposed that high density cloud robotics will be deployed in the future, the 5G system need to optimize the resource efficiency for such scenario.;POSSIBLE
22261-j30;6.4.1	Description;Additional resource efficiencies will contribute to meeting the various KPIs defined for 5G. Control plane resource efficiencies can be achieved by optimizing and minimizing signalling overhead, particularly for small data transmissions. Mechanisms for minimizing user plane resources utilization include in-network caching and application in a Service Hosting Environment closer to the end user. These optimization efforts contribute to achieving lower latency and higher reliability.;POSSIBLE
22261-j30;6.4.2.1	General;The 5G system shall optimize the resource use of the control plane and/or user plane for transfer of continuous uplink data that requires both high data rate (e.g. 10 Mbit/s) and very low end-to-end latency (e.g. 1-10 ms).;POSSIBLE
22261-j30;6.4.2.1	General;-	The 5G system with satellite access shall support the use of satellite links between the radio access network and core network, by enhancing the 3GPP system to handle the latencies introduced by satellite backhaul.;POSSIBLE
22261-j30;6.5.1	Description;User plane should be more efficient for 5G to support differentiated requirements. On one hand, a Service Hosting Environment located inside of operator's network can offer Hosted Services closer to the end user to meet localization requirement like low latency, low bandwidth pressure. These Hosted Services contain applications provided by operators and/or trusted 3rd parties. On the other hand, user plane paths can be selected or changed to improve the user experience or reduce the bandwidth pressure, when a UE or application changes location during an active communication.;POSSIBLE
22261-j30;6.7.1		Description;The 5G network will support many commercial services (e.g. medical) and regional or national regulatory services (e.g. MPS, Emergency, Public Safety) with requirements for priority treatment. Some of these services share common QoS characteristics such as latency and packet loss rate but can have different priority requirements. For example, UAV control and air traffic control can have stringent latency and reliability requirements but not necessarily the same priority requirements. In addition, voice-based services for MPS and Emergency share common QoS characteristics as applicable for normal public voice communications yet can have different priority requirements. The 5G network will need to support mechanisms that enable the decoupling of the priority of a particular communication from the associated QoS characteristics such as latency and reliability to allow flexibility to support different priority services (that need to be configurable to meet operator needs, consistent with operator policies and corresponding national and regional regulatory policies).;POSSIBLE
22261-j30;6.7.1		Description;The network must offer means to provide the required QoS (e.g. reliability, latency, and bandwidth) for a service and the ability to prioritize resources when necessary to meet the service requirements. Existing QoS and policy frameworks handle latency and improve reliability by traffic engineering. In order to support 5G service requirements, it is necessary for the 5G network to offer QoS and policy control for reliable communication with latency required for a service and enable the resource adaptations as necessary.;POSSIBLE
22261-j30;6.7.1		Description;Further, for QoS control in EPS only covers RAN and core network, but for 5G network E2E QoS (e.g. RAN, backhaul, core network, network to network interconnect) is needed to achieve the 5G user experience (e.g. ultra-low latency, ultra-high bandwidth).;POSSIBLE
22261-j30;6.7.2		Requirements;The 5G system shall be able to provide the required QoS (e.g. reliability, end-to-end latency, and bandwidth) for a service and support prioritization of resources when necessary for that service.;POSSIBLE
22261-j30;6.7.2		Requirements;The 5G system shall allow decoupling of the priority of a particular communication from the associated QoS characteristics such as end-to-end latency and reliability.;POSSIBLE
22261-j30;6.7.2		Requirements;The 5G system shall support a mechanism to determine suitable QoS parameters for traffic over a satellite backhaul, based e.g. on the latency and bandwidth of the specific backhaul . ;POSSIBLE

22261-j30;6.23.1	Description ;The QoS requirements specified for particular services such as URLLC services, vertical automation communication services, and V2X, mandate QoS guarantees from the network. However, the network cannot always guarantee the required QoS of the service. An example reason for this shortcoming is that the latency and/or packet error rate increase due to interference in a radio cell. In such cases, it is critical that the application and/or application server is notified in a timely manner. Hence, the 5G system should be able to support QoS monitoring/assurance for URLLC services, V2X and vertical automation.;POSSIBLE

22261-j30;6.42.2	Requirements;For immersive multi-modal VR applications, synchronization between different media components is critical in order to avoid having a negative impact on the user experience (i.e. viewers detecting lack of synchronization), particularly when the synchronization threshold between two or more modalities is less than the latency KPI for the application. Example synchronization thresholds [41] [42] [43] [44] are summarised in table 6.43.1-1.;POSSIBLE
22261-j30;7.2.1	Overview;Several scenarios require the support of very low latency and very high communications service availability. Note that this implies a very high reliability. The overall service latency depends on the delay on the radio interface, transmission within the 5G system, transmission to a server which can be outside the 5G system, and data processing. Some of these factors depend directly on the 5G system itself, whereas for others the impact can be reduced by suitable interconnections between the 5G system and services or servers outside of the 5G system, for example, to allow local hosting of the services.;POSSIBLE
22261-j30;7.2.2	Scenarios and KPIs ;-	Motion control – Conventional motion control is characterised by high requirements on the communications system regarding latency, reliability, and availability. Systems supporting motion control are usually deployed in geographically limited areas but can also be deployed in wider areas (e.g. city- or country-wide networks), access to them can be limited to authorized users, and they can be isolated from networks or network resources used by other cellular customers.;POSSIBLE
22261-j30;7.2.2	Scenarios and KPIs ;-	Automation for electricity distribution and smart grid (mainly medium and high voltage). Electricity distribution and smart grid are is characterized by high requirements on the communications service availability and security, as well as low latency in some cases. In contrast to the above use cases, electricity distribution and smart grid are deeply immersed into the public space. Since electricity distribution is an essential infrastructure, it is well served by network slices to provide service isolation and security, or by non-public networks.;POSSIBLE
22261-j30;7.2.2	Scenarios and KPIs ;-	Rail communications (e.g. railway, rail-bound mass transit) have been using 3GPP based mobile communication (e.g. GSM-R) already for some time, while there is still a driver on-board of the train. The next step of the evolution will be providing fully automated train operation that requires highly reliable communication with moderate latencies but at very high speeds of up to 500 km/h.;POSSIBLE

22261-j30;D.1.0		General;In a closed-loop control application, the controller periodically submits instructions to a set of sensor/actuator devices, which return a response within a so-called cycle time. The messages, which are referred to as telegrams, are typically small (≤ 56 bytes). The cycle time can be as low as 2 ms, setting stringent end-to-end latency constraints on telegram forwarding (≤ 1 ms). Additional constraints on isochronous telegram delivery add tight constraints on the lateness (1 s), and the communication service has also to be highly available (99,9999%). ;POSSIBLE
22261-j30;D.1.0		General;A typical industrial closed-loop motion control application is based on individual control events. Each closed-loop control event consists of a downlink transaction followed by a synchronous uplink transaction, both of which are executed within a cycle time. Control events within a manufacturing unit might need to occur isochronously. Factory automation considers application layer transaction cycles between controller devices and sensor/actuator devices. Each transaction cycle consists of (1) a command sent by the controller to the sensor/actuator (downlink), (2) application-layer processing on the sensor/actuator device, and (3) a subsequent response by the sensor/actuator to the controller (uplink). Cycle time includes the entire transaction from the transmission of a command by the controller to the reception of a response by the controller. It includes all lower layer processes and latencies on the radio interface as well the application-layer processing time on the sensor/actuator.;POSSIBLE
22261-j30;D.2.0		General;"The related use cases require support of a large number of sensor devices per plant, as well as high communication service availability (99,99%). Furthermore, power consumption is relevant since some sensor devices are battery-powered with a targeted battery lifetime of several years (while providing measurement updates every few seconds). Range also becomes a critical factor due to the low transmit power levels of the sensors, the large size of the plant, and the high-reliability requirements on transport. End-to-end latency requirements typically range between 10 ms and 1 s. User-experienced data rates can be rather low since each transaction typically comprises less than 256 bytes. However, there has been a shift from field busses featuring somewhat modest data rates (~ 2 Mbit/s) to those with higher data rates (~ 10 Mbit/s) due to the increasing number of distributed applications and ""data-hungry"" applications. An example for the latter is the visual control of production processes. For this application, the user experienced data rate is typically around 10 Mbit/s and the transmitted packets are much larger than what was stated earlier.";POSSIBLE
22261-j30;D.2.0		General;The use of licensed spectrum could overcome the vulnerability to same-band interference and therefore enable higher reliability. Utilization of licensed spectrum can be confined to those events where high interference bursts in unlicensed bands jeopardizes communication service availability and end-to-end latency constraints. This allows sharing the licensed spectrum between process automation and conventional mobile services.;POSSIBLE
22261-j30;D.3.0		General;Process automation has much in common with factory automation (see clause D.2). Instead of discrete products (cars, chocolate bars, etc.), process automation addresses the production of bulk products such as petrol and reactive gases. In contrast to factory automation, motion control is of limited or no importance. Typical end-to-end latencies are 50 ms. User-experienced data rates, communication service availability, and connection density vary noticeably between applications. Below, we describe one emerging use case (remote control via mobile computational units, clause D.3.1) and a contemporary use case (monitoring, clause D.3.2).;POSSIBLE
22261-j30;D.4.1.0		Overview;"A use case that could also be realised in the future is fault isolation and system restoration (FISR). FISR automates the management of faults in the distribution grid. It supports the localization of the fault, the isolation of the fault, and the restoration of the power delivery. For this kind of automation, the pertinent sensors and actuators broadcast telegrams about their states (e.g., ""emergency closer idle"") and about actions (e.g., ""activating closer"") into the backhaul network. This information is used by the ring main units (RMUs) as input for their decision algorithms. We illustrate this use of automation telegrams for an automated FISR event in figure D.4.1.0-1. Let us assume the distribution lines are cut at the location indicated by the bolt of lightning in the figure. In that case, the RMUs between the bolt and the green load switch (open) will be without power. The RMUs next to the ""bolt"" automatically open their load switches after having sensed the loss of electric connectivity between them. They both broadcast these actions into the backhaul network. Typically, these telegrams are repeated many times while the time between adjacent telegrams increases exponentially. This communication patterns leads to sudden, distributed surges in the consumed communication bandwidth. After the RMUs next to the ""bolt"" have opened their switch, the RMU that so far has kept the power line ring open (green dot in figure D.4.1.0-1) closes the load switch. This event too is broadcasted into the backhaul network. The typical maximum end-to-end latency for this kind of broadcast is 25 ms with a peak experienced data rate of 10 Mbit/s. Note that the distribution system typically subscribes to telegrams from all RMUs in order to keep abreast with the happenings in the distribution grid. ";POSSIBLE
22261-j30;D.4.2.0		Overview;This kind of automation requires very low end-to-end latencies (5 ms) [16] and―due to its critical importance for the operation of society―a very high communication service availability (99,9999%).;POSSIBLE
22261-j30;D.5.0 	General;RSUs are connected to the traffic control centre for management and control purposes. They broadcast, e.g., traffic light information (RSU  vehicle) and traffic information from the traffic-control centre (TCC) via the RSU to the vehicles (TCC  RSU  vehicle). RSUs also collect vehicle probe data for the traffic control centre (vehicle  RSU  TCC). For reliable distribution of data, low-latency and high-capacity connections between RSUs (e.g. traffic lights, traffic signs, etc.) and the TCC are required. This type of application comes with rather tight end-to-end latency requirements for the communication service between RSU and TCC (10 ms), since relayed data needs to be processed in the TCC and, if needed, the results are forwarded to neighbouring RSUs. Also, the availability of the communication service has to be very high (99,9999%) in order to compete with existing wired technology and in order to justify the costly deployment and maintenance of RSUs. Furthermore, due to considerably large aggregation areas (see clause D.5.1), considerable amounts of data need to be backhauled to the TCC (up to 10 Mbit/s per RSU).;POSSIBLE
22261-j30;F.1	QoS monitoring for assurance;The start time and the duration of the QoS monitoring is specified in the parameter observation time interval, which is exchanged between the customer, for instance an application consuming a communication service, and the provider (for instance a private 5G network providing a communication service). The observation time interval is the time interval during which a series of measurements is conducted. In the context of QoS monitoring, these are the measurements necessary for assessing the QoS of communication services, for instance the measurement of end-to-end latencies.;POSSIBLE

22263;4.2.1	System latency;The overall system latency has an important impact on the applications that this specification targets. In video production, overall system latency is referred to as imaging system latency and has an impact on the timing of synchronized cameras. For audio applications, overall system latency is referred to as mouth to ear latency and it is critical to maintain lip sync and avoid a performer to be put off by hearing their own echo. Finally, in medical applications the system latency impairs the achievable precision at a given gesture speed as it translates the time needed to traverse the whole imaging system into a geometrical error of the instruments position. ;POSSIBLE
22263;4.3	AV production ;The performance aspects that are covered in this document also target the latency that these services experience. Since these applications involve physical feedback on performances that are happening live, the latency requirements are very strict.

There are some situations where the latency is less important but it is very important to capture what is visible in front of the camera at the precise time. These different requirements do not necessarily relate to the level of situational Emergency and so there is a difference in a MCVideo service between Emergency and urgency.;POSSIBLE

This latency might also be higher due to different causes such as, e.g., hardware processing. This latency might also be variable due to multiple reasons, such as, e.g., congestion or delays introduced by (variable processing time of) hardware components such as sensors or rendering devices. Since this value maybe too high and variable for a truly immersive joint location agnostic metaverse service experience, each of the deployed avatars includes one or more predictive models of the person it represents and that allow rendering in the local edge server a synchronized predicted (current) digital representation (i.e. avatar) of the remote users.

The motion-to-photon latency requires that the latency between the moment that players do one movement and the corresponding new videos shown in VR glasses and tactile from vibrating backpacks or haptic gloves should be less than 20ms. As the asynchrony between different modalities increases, users’ experience will decrease because uses are able to detect asynchronies. Therefore, the synchronisation among audio, visual and tactile is also very important.

To overcome this issue, when the battery level reaches a certain value, a part of the AI/ML model can be transferred to a service hosting environment and / or to another robot by splitting the AI/ML model as defined in [20]. The split model approach of [20] is applicable to a UE-to-UE (or robot-to-robot) architecture. Thus, the AI/ML model M is split and shared between (e.g.) 2 robots, say an assisted robot and an assistant robot. Intermediate data generated by the assisted robot are transferred to the assisting robot which finalizes the inference and transmits the results back to the assisted robot. This intermediate data transfer must be extremely efficient in terms of latency and throughput.

For example, some of AI/ML training, simulation, and video processing tasks might not require a quick response, which would allow flexibility to delay the execution of the related workloads in a computing node until, e.g., the utilized energy is deemed satisfactory in terms of GHG emissions. Such flexibility further allows to route workloads to a computing node using the (most) sustainable energy sources at that moment.
