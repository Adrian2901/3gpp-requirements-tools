23433-i00;9.7.2.1	Data transmission quality measurement ;2.	The VAL server sends a SEALDD transmission quality measurement subscription request to the SEALDD server. The request includes the identifiers of the application traffic (e.g. VAL service ID, VAL server ID), requirement of transmission quality measurement (e.g. latency, jitter, bitrate, packet loss rate) and measurement target UE (e.g. a single UE, a group of UEs or all UEs), and may also include reporting criteria, reporting frequency, spatial condition and temporal condition.;POSSIBLE
23433-i00;9.7.2.1	Data transmission quality measurement ;4.	If the transmission quality measurement requirement list provided by VAL server in step 2, indicates that the latency is needed to be measured, the SEALDD server initiates the DL packet delay measurement. The SEALDD server encapsulates the DL monitoring packet (i.e. DL SEALDD packet with SEALDD DL monitoring header and VAL traffic as payload, or dummy DL SEALDD packet generated for data transmission quality monitoring) with local time T1 when the SEALDD server sends out the DL monitoring packets. The SEALDD server considers the spatial and/or temporal conditions when starting/resuming the transmission quality measurement.

The SEALDD server records the local time T4 when the SEALDD server receives the UL monitoring packet and calculates the latency with T1, T2, T3, T4. The SEALDD server can also calculate the bitrate, jitter and packet loss rate over a certain period over a specific SEALDD connection by recording the status of the SEALDD packets carrying VAL traffic or dummy SEALDD packets generated for transmission quality measurement reports.

23433-i00;9.7.2.3	Data transmission quality measurement reported by SEALDD client;2.	The VAL server sends a SEALDD transmission quality measurement subscription request to the SEALDD server. The request includes the identifiers of the application traffic (e.g. VAL service ID, VAL server ID), requirement of transmission quality measurement (e.g. latency, jitter, bitrate) and measurement target UE (e.g. a single UE, a group of UEs or all UEs), and may also include reporting criteria, reporting frequency, spatial condition and temporal condition.;POSSIBLE

23433-i00;9.9.2.2	SEALDD enabled data transmission quality guarantee with redundant transport;1.	A VAL client and server establish a SEALDD connection to transport the application data. As part of the connection establishment, the SEALDD service policy in precondition 1 is shared so that it is available to both the SEALDD client and the SEALDD Server. The SEALDD Server may use the data transmission quality requirements of this policy in conjunction with other local policies pre-provisioned at the SEALDD server. The SEALDD server determines whether to start data transmission quality measurement by itself or by the SEALDD client. As a result, SEALDD measurements (e.g. packet loss rate, latency) are configured either at the SEALDD client as described in clause 9.7.2.3 or at the SEALDD server as described in clause 9.7.2.1 and started accordingly. Then either the SEALDD client or server receives measurement reports.;POSSIBLE

The service requirement from the source includes packet size, packet transmission interval, packet E2E latency, allowed packet loss rate/packet loss amount/packet error rate, etc. The destination may be multiple UEs (devices). The identity of source and destination may be the application user identity or the MAC address.;POSSIBLE
23434-i50;14.3.12.4.3	Network parameter coordination procedure;The network parameter coordination  procedure uses UE unified traffic pattern information  to influence aspects of UE/network behaviour such as the UE's PSM and extended idle mode DR14. For this purpose, parameter values may be suggested for Maximum Latency and Maximum Response Time for a UE. 5GC may choose to accept, reject or modify the suggested configuration parameter value.;POSSIBLE
23434-i50;14.3.12.4.3	Network parameter coordination procedure;-	maximumLatency – This value tells the network how long the UE is allowed to sleep.  Setting it to 0 will disable PSM, extended idle mode DRX, and extended buffering. The NRM Server can extract the periodicity derived from the UE unified traffic pattern, which includes the schedule elements for the UEs communications with all VAL servers. The NRM Server sets Maximum Latency to be approximately the periodicity of the active periods derived from the schedule element of the UE unified traffic pattern.;POSSIBLE
23435-i00;9.5.2.1.1	VAL server policy provisioning ;-	Based on the monitored time period, when getting to a certain time period, trigger the slice modification based on the expected QoS per UE. QoS is mapped/calculated by NSCE to specific parameters of the slice such as the dLThptPerUE, uLThptPerUE, dLThptPerSliceSubnet, uLThptPerSliceSubnet, delayTolerance, dLLatency, uLLatency.;POSSIBLE
23435-i00;9.5.2.2	Network slice optimization based on VAL server policy;4.	Upon receiving the notification which indicating the trigger event is met, i.e., the monitored information reaches the threshold or specific time period is arrived, the NSCE server performs the expected action by triggering the slice modification as specified in the VAL server policy. The network slice modification could be triggered by consuming the Network Slice Provisioning service with the modifyMOIAttributes operation as specified in TS 28.531 [8]. The OAM responds back to NSCE server that the requested slice modification was successful or not. The slice modification requests contain the parameters need to be updated to fit the requirement of network slice (e.g., scale in or scale out the network slice capability), including at least one of the following, uLThptPerSlice, dLThptPerSlice, dLThptPerUE, uLThptPerUE, dLThptPerSliceSubnet, uLThptPerSliceSubnet, delayTolerance, dLLatency, uLLatency, maximum number of UEs, maximum number of PDU session as specified in TS 28.541 [10].;POSSIBLE

The NSCE may perform the translation by pre-configured industry profiles or by KQI-KPI translation algorithms which are out scope of standard. The procedures of APIs translation defined in clause 9.3 are referred to.;POSSIBLE
23435-i00;9.17.2.1	Network Slice Information delivery request;NOTE:	If NSCE server and NSMF are in same operator, then the NSCE server gets access directly to NSMF. The delivered Network Slice Service Profile contains the values of attributes such as PLMN, S-NSSAI, SST, maximum number of UEs, maximum number of PDU sessions, Slice Coverage Area, Latency, and, Data volume, which specify the Network Slice characteristics, as specified in clause of ServiceProfile in 3GPP TS 28.541 [10].  ;POSSIBLE
23436-i00;8.3.2	Procedure;7.	The ADAES abstracts or correlates the data/analytics from steps 4-6 and provides analytics on the slice or NSI performance for the the target VAL application/server. For example, such analytics can be about the min/average/max predicted RTT / end to end latency for the VAL application/server if this server uses a given slice/NSI (or for a list of given slices) within an area of interest.;POSSIBLE
23436-i00;8.4.2	Procedure;4.	The ADAES sends a UE to UE analytics request to the ADAEC #1 with the analytics event ID and the configuration of the reporting required (e.g., periodic, based on threshold or event). Such request also includes the application QoS attributes to be analyzed (latency, jitter, PER,..)A session starts between the VAL UE #1 and a VAL UE #2 (or more VAL UEs). ;POSSIBLE
23436-i00;8.4.2	Procedure;5.	The ADAEC #1 starts collecting data from the corresponding VAL UE(s) based on the request. Such data can be about the latency, throughput, jitter, QoE measurements, PQI load, etc.  The data can be collected by ADAEC #1 from other ADAECs via ADAE-C interface, or from the VAL clients (VAL client to VAL client interaction is out of scope).;POSSIBLE
23436-i00;8.4.2	Procedure;6.	The ADAEC either detects or predicts an application QoS change (depending on the authorization of ADAEC to perform analytics). Such change can be for example an application QoS downgrade related to the UE-to-UE session latency, or the PER/channel losses higher than a predefined threshold, for a given time horizon with a certain confidence level.;POSSIBLE
23501-i22;4.1	General concepts;-	Support concurrent access to local and centralized services. To support low latency services and local access to data networks, UP functions can be deployed close to the Access Network.;POSSIBLE
23501-i22;5.4.1.4	Support of Unavailability Period;"6)	While the UE is unreachable, all high latency communication solutions (see clause 5.31.8) apply if supported in the network, e.g. extended data buffering, downlink data buffering status report, etc; and";POSSIBLE
23501-i22;5.4.9.1	General;To avoid waking up UEs due to an AMF paging other UEs across multiple cells (e.g. due to frequent UE mobility and/or for low paging latency services such as VoLTE), the use of WUS by the ng-eNB and the UE is restricted to the last used cell, i.e. the cell in which the UE's RRC connection was last released. To support this:;POSSIBLE
23501-i22;5.4.12.2	Core Network Assistance for PEIPS;NOTE 1:	To minimise MT voice call setup latency, the AMF could allocate Paging Subgroup IDs taking into account whether or not the UE is likely to receive IMS voice over PS session calls.;POSSIBLE
23501-i22;5.4.13.1	Mobility Management and Power Saving Optimization;The AMF should adjust the mobile reachable timer or Implicit Deregistration timer or both such that the AMF does not implicitly deregister the UE while the UE is unavailable, see clause 5.4.1. Features described for High latency communication in clause 5.31.8 may be used to handle mobile terminated (MT) communication with UEs being unreachable due to discontinuous coverage and the Unavailability Period Duration and Start of Unavailability Period (if available) may be used to when determining Maximum Time Offset.;POSSIBLE
23501-i22;5.6.7.1	General;12)	User Plane Latency Requirement. This includes AF requirements for User Plane latency. (see clause 6.3.6 of TS 23.548 [130]).;NO
23501-i22;5.6.7.1	General;The PCF may also provide in the PCC rule information to subscribe the AF (or the NEF) to SMF events (UP path changes) corresponding to the AF request in which case it provides the information on AF subscription to corresponding SMF events received in the AF request. This is done by providing policies at PDU Session set-up or by initiating a PDU Session Modification procedure. When initiating a PDU Session set-up or PDU Session Modification procedure, the PCF considers the latest known UE location to determine the PCC rules provided to the SMF. The PCF evaluates the temporal validity condition of the AF request and informs the SMF to activate or deactivate the corresponding PCC rules according to the evaluation result. When policies specific to the PDU Session and policies general to multiple PDU Sessions exist, the PCF gives precedence to the PDU Session specific policies over the general policies. The PCF authorizes the AF request of User Plane Latency Requirements. If the PCF determines that the requirements can't be authorized, the PCF rejects the AF request.;POSSIBLE
23501-i22;5.6.7.1	General;-	(re)select UP paths (including DNAI(s)) for PDU Sessions. The SMF is responsible for handling the mapping between the UE location (TAI / Cell-Id) and DNAI(s) associated with UPF and applications and the selection of the UPF(s) that serve a PDU Session. This is described in clause 6.3.3. If the PDU Session is of IP type and if Indication of UE IP address preservation is included in the PCC rules, the SMF should preserve the UE IP address, by not reselecting the related PSA UPF once the PSA UPF is selected, for the traffic identified in the PCC rule. If the user plane latency requirement is included in the PCC rules, the SMF chooses the PSA UPF that satisfies the user plane latency requirement. If the PCC rules are related to a 5G VN group served by the SMF and if the PCC rule includes an indication of traffic correlation, the SMF should select a common DNAI for the PDU Sessions of the 5G VN group, see clause 5.29.;POSSIBLE
23501-i22;5.13	Support for Edge Computing;Edge computing enables operator and 3rd party services to be hosted close to the UE's access point of attachment, so as to achieve an efficient service delivery through the reduced end-to-end latency and load on the transport network. Edge Computing support by 5GC is specified in this specification and in TS 23.548 [130].;POSSIBLE
23501-i22;5.17.5.1	General;-	Network Parameter Configuration Information (e.g. Maximum Response Time and Maximum Latency).;POSSIBLE
23501-i22;5.31.7.2.1	Overview;If an eDRX cycle is applied in RRC_INACTIVE, the RAN can buffer DL packets up to the duration of the eDRX cycle chosen by NG-RAN if the eDRX cycle does not last more than 10.24 seconds. If the CN based MT communication handling support indication is received in RRC Inactive Assistance Information, the NG-RAN may select an eDRX cycle that lasts more than 10.24s. In this case, based on implementation the NG-RAN may send an indication in N2 message that the UE is transitioning to RRC_INACTIVE state and the selected eDRX cycle value to the AMF. The CN takes the indication in the N2 message into account, then handles mobile terminated (MT) communication as specified in clause 5.31.7.2.4 and it can apply high latency communication as specified in clause 5.31.8. The AMF replies to NG-RAN that the indication in the N2 message has been taken into account and the MT signalling or data may be buffered by the Core Network based on high latency communication. If and when the NG-RAN chooses to send the indication is up to NG-RAN implementation. If the NG-RAN delays sending the indication and it receives a DL NAS message for the UE, the NG-RAN proceeds as described in clause 4.8.1.1a of TS 23.502 [3].;POSSIBLE
23501-i22;5.31.7.2.1	Overview;NOTE 4:	If the indication that the UE is transitioning to RRC_INACTIVE state is not sent (or sent after UE has entered RRC_INACTIVE state) by the NG-RAN then until CN receives it the CN cannot apply the high latency communication functionality, other NFs will not be aware of the UE reachability, certain high latency communication related services provided to the AF via NEF would not be available, NAS message delivery might fail and downlink data in RAN might be lost.;POSSIBLE
23501-i22;5.31.7.2.4	Paging for extended DRX for RRC_INACTIVE in NR connected to 5GC;For NR, the NG-RAN may request the CN to handle mobile terminated (MT) communication for the UE configured with eDRX for RRC_INACTIVE state by means of the Connection Inactive procedure with CN based MT communication handling Procedure (see clause 4.8.1.1a of TS 23.502 [3]). This allows the CN to apply high latency communication functions as specified in clause 5.31.8. The NG-RAN provides the eDRX cycle value for RRC_INACTIVE to AMF (i.e. >10.24s). Based on the request from NG-RAN, the AMF responds to NG-RAN and informs other NFs (e.g. SMF and UPF) involved in downlink data or signalling handling and trigger the data buffering as specified in clause 4.8.1.1a of TS 23.502 [3].;POSSIBLE
23501-i22;5.31.7.2.4	Paging for extended DRX for RRC_INACTIVE in NR connected to 5GC;When MT data or signalling arrives for a UE in RRC_INACTIVE state, the other NFs communicate with the AMF for delivery of MT data or signalling. The AMF calculates the UE reachability based on the eDRX cycle value for RRC_INACTIVE state provided by NG-RAN and triggers NG-RAN paging via an N2 DL Data Notification message if the UE is considered reachable as specified in clause 4.8.2.2b of TS 23.502 [3]. Otherwise, the AMF stores the information received in the NF request and replies to the requesting NF to apply high latency communication functions as specified in clause 5.31.8 based on eDRX cycle for RRC_INACTIVE (e.g. an Estimated Maximum Wait Time is calculated based on eDRX cycle value for RRC_INACTIVE). When the AMF determines that the UE has become reachable for paging, the AMF uses the stored information to send an N2 DL Data Notification message.;POSSIBLE
23501-i22;5.31.7.2.4	Paging for extended DRX for RRC_INACTIVE in NR connected to 5GC;When the UE resumes the RRC connection as specified in TS 38.300 [27] (e.g. including mobile originated small data transmission procedure), if the NG-RAN had sent the indication for the CN to handle mobile terminated (MT) communication, NG-RAN proceeds as specified in clause 4.8.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3], which indicates to the AMF that the UE is now reachable for downlink data and/or signalling. The AMF then informs other NFs that the UE is now reachable using the high latency communication functions as specified in clause 5.31.8 and MT data and signalling can be delivered to the UE.;POSSIBLE
23501-i22;5.31.7.5	MICO mode and Periodic Registration Timer Control;If the Expected UE Behaviour indicates scheduled DL communication the AMF should allow MICO mode for the UE and allocate a periodic registration timer value such that the UE performs Periodic Registration Update to renegotiate MICO mode before or at the scheduled DL communication time, if the AMF decides to allow MICO mode for the UE. When UE requests the MICO mode with active time, the UE may also request a periodic registration timer value suitable for the latency/responsiveness of the DL communication service known to UE. If the UE wants to change the periodic registration timer value, e.g. when the conditions are changed in the UE, the UE consequently requests the value it wants in the registration procedure. The AMF takes the UE requested periodic registration time value into consideration when providing the periodic registration timer to UE during Registration procedure as specified in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3].;POSSIBLE
23501-i22;5.31.8	High latency communication;5.31.8	High latency communication;NO
23501-i22;5.31.8	High latency communication;"Functions for High latency communication may be used to handle mobile terminated (MT) communication with UEs being unreachable while using power saving functions as specified in clause 5.31.7 or due to discontinuous coverage as described in clause 5.4.13. ""High latency"" refers to the initial response time before normal exchange of packets is established. That is, the time it takes before a UE has woken up from its power saving state and responded to an initial downlink packet or signal.";POSSIBLE
23501-i22;5.31.8	High latency communication;When a NR RedCap UE requests to use the power saving functions as specified in clause 5.31.7, then the AMF may, based on local policy, reroute the Registration Request to another AMF that supports High latency communication as specified in clause 6.3.5.;POSSIBLE
23501-i22;5.31.8	High latency communication;High latency communication is supported by extended buffering of downlink data in the UPF, SMF or NEF when a UE is using power saving functions in CM-IDLE state or in RRC_INACTIVE state, or when the UE is using a satellite access with discontinuous coverage and the UE is not reachable. For UPF anchored PDU sessions the SMF configures during AN release or when NG-RAN indicates via the AMF the UE is in extended DRX for RRC_INACTIVE, the UPF with user data Forwarding Action Rule and user data Buffering Action Rule according to TS 29.244 [65]. The rules include instructions whether UPF buffering applies or the user data shall be forwarded to the SMF for buffering in the SMF. For NEF anchored PDU sessions only extended buffering in the NEF is supported in this release of the specification. During the Network Triggered Service Request procedure or Mobile Terminated Data Transport procedures when using Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, the AMF provides an Estimated Maximum Wait Time to the SMF if the SMF indicates the support of extended buffering. The SMF determines the Extended Buffering Time based on the received Estimated Maximum Wait Time or local configuration. The handling is e.g. specified in the Network Triggered Service Request procedure, clauses 4.2.3.3, 4.2.6, 4.24.2 and 4.25.5 of TS 23.502 [3].;POSSIBLE

23501-i22;5.31.8	High latency communication;An AF may provide parameters related to High latency communication for different methods to UDM, via NEF, as part of provisioning capability as specified in clause 5.20. The UDM can further deliver the parameters to other NFs (e.g. AMF or SMF) as specified in clause 4.15.6 of TS 23.502 [3].;POSSIBLE
23501-i22;5.31.16	Service Gap Control;"Service Gap Control is an optional feature intended for CIoT UEs to control the frequency at which these UEs can access the network. That is, to ensure a minimum time gap between consecutive Mobile Originated data communications initiated by the UE. This helps reducing peak load situations when there are a large number of these UEs in an operator network. Service Gap Control is intended to be used for ""small data allowance plans"" for MTC/CIoT UEs where the applications are tolerant to service latency.";POSSIBLE
23501-i22;5.31.16	Service Gap Control;NOTE 1:	Time critical applications, such as regulatory prioritized services like Emergency services can suffer from the latency caused by the Service Gap Control feature. Therefore Service Gap Control feature is not recommended for subscriptions with such applications and services.;POSSIBLE
