test;5.4.1.4	Support of Unavailability Period;"6)	While the UE is unreachable, all high latency communication solutions (see clause 5.31.8) apply if supported in the network, e.g. extended data buffering, downlink data buffering status report, etc; and";YES
test;5.4.9.1	General;To avoid waking up UEs due to an AMF paging other UEs across multiple cells (e.g. due to frequent UE mobility and/or for low paging latency services such as VoLTE), the use of WUS by the ng-eNB and the UE is restricted to the last used cell, i.e. the cell in which the UE's RRC connection was last released. To support this:;YES
test;5.4.12.2	Core Network Assistance for PEIPS;NOTE 1:	To minimise MT voice call setup latency, the AMF could allocate Paging Subgroup IDs taking into account whether or not the UE is likely to receive IMS voice over PS session calls.;YES
test;5.4.13.1	Mobility Management and Power Saving Optimization;The AMF should adjust the mobile reachable timer or Implicit Deregistration timer or both such that the AMF does not implicitly deregister the UE while the UE is unavailable, see clause 5.4.1. Features described for High latency communication in clause 5.31.8 may be used to handle mobile terminated (MT) communication with UEs being unreachable due to discontinuous coverage and the Unavailability Period Duration and Start of Unavailability Period (if available) may be used to when determining Maximum Time Offset.;YES
test;5.6.7.1	General;12)	User Plane Latency Requirement. This includes AF requirements for User Plane latency. (see clause 6.3.6 of TS 23.548 [130]).;NO
test;5.6.7.1	General;The PCF may also provide in the PCC rule information to subscribe the AF (or the NEF) to SMF events (UP path changes) corresponding to the AF request in which case it provides the information on AF subscription to corresponding SMF events received in the AF request. This is done by providing policies at PDU Session set-up or by initiating a PDU Session Modification procedure. When initiating a PDU Session set-up or PDU Session Modification procedure, the PCF considers the latest known UE location to determine the PCC rules provided to the SMF. The PCF evaluates the temporal validity condition of the AF request and informs the SMF to activate or deactivate the corresponding PCC rules according to the evaluation result. When policies specific to the PDU Session and policies general to multiple PDU Sessions exist, the PCF gives precedence to the PDU Session specific policies over the general policies. The PCF authorizes the AF request of User Plane Latency Requirements. If the PCF determines that the requirements can't be authorized, the PCF rejects the AF request.;YES
test;5.6.7.1	General;-	(re)select UP paths (including DNAI(s)) for PDU Sessions. The SMF is responsible for handling the mapping between the UE location (TAI / Cell-Id) and DNAI(s) associated with UPF and applications and the selection of the UPF(s) that serve a PDU Session. This is described in clause 6.3.3. If the PDU Session is of IP type and if Indication of UE IP address preservation is included in the PCC rules, the SMF should preserve the UE IP address, by not reselecting the related PSA UPF once the PSA UPF is selected, for the traffic identified in the PCC rule. If the user plane latency requirement is included in the PCC rules, the SMF chooses the PSA UPF that satisfies the user plane latency requirement. If the PCC rules are related to a 5G VN group served by the SMF and if the PCC rule includes an indication of traffic correlation, the SMF should select a common DNAI for the PDU Sessions of the 5G VN group, see clause 5.29.;YES
test;5.13	Support for Edge Computing;Edge computing enables operator and 3rd party services to be hosted close to the UE's access point of attachment, so as to achieve an efficient service delivery through the reduced end-to-end latency and load on the transport network. Edge Computing support by 5GC is specified in this specification and in TS 23.548 [130].;NO
test;5.17.5.1	General;-	Network Parameter Configuration Information (e.g. Maximum Response Time and Maximum Latency).;YES
test;5.31.7.2.1	Overview;If an eDRX cycle is applied in RRC_INACTIVE, the RAN can buffer DL packets up to the duration of the eDRX cycle chosen by NG-RAN if the eDRX cycle does not last more than 10.24 seconds. If the CN based MT communication handling support indication is received in RRC Inactive Assistance Information, the NG-RAN may select an eDRX cycle that lasts more than 10.24s. In this case, based on implementation the NG-RAN may send an indication in N2 message that the UE is transitioning to RRC_INACTIVE state and the selected eDRX cycle value to the AMF. The CN takes the indication in the N2 message into account, then handles mobile terminated (MT) communication as specified in clause 5.31.7.2.4 and it can apply high latency communication as specified in clause 5.31.8. The AMF replies to NG-RAN that the indication in the N2 message has been taken into account and the MT signalling or data may be buffered by the Core Network based on high latency communication. If and when the NG-RAN chooses to send the indication is up to NG-RAN implementation. If the NG-RAN delays sending the indication and it receives a DL NAS message for the UE, the NG-RAN proceeds as described in clause 4.8.1.1a of TS 23.502 [3].;YES
test;5.31.7.2.1	Overview;NOTE 4:	If the indication that the UE is transitioning to RRC_INACTIVE state is not sent (or sent after UE has entered RRC_INACTIVE state) by the NG-RAN then until CN receives it the CN cannot apply the high latency communication functionality, other NFs will not be aware of the UE reachability, certain high latency communication related services provided to the AF via NEF would not be available, NAS message delivery might fail and downlink data in RAN might be lost.;YES
test;5.31.7.2.4	Paging for extended DRX for RRC_INACTIVE in NR connected to 5GC;For NR, the NG-RAN may request the CN to handle mobile terminated (MT) communication for the UE configured with eDRX for RRC_INACTIVE state by means of the Connection Inactive procedure with CN based MT communication handling Procedure (see clause 4.8.1.1a of TS 23.502 [3]). This allows the CN to apply high latency communication functions as specified in clause 5.31.8. The NG-RAN provides the eDRX cycle value for RRC_INACTIVE to AMF (i.e. >10.24s). Based on the request from NG-RAN, the AMF responds to NG-RAN and informs other NFs (e.g. SMF and UPF) involved in downlink data or signalling handling and trigger the data buffering as specified in clause 4.8.1.1a of TS 23.502 [3].;YES
test;5.31.7.2.4	Paging for extended DRX for RRC_INACTIVE in NR connected to 5GC;When MT data or signalling arrives for a UE in RRC_INACTIVE state, the other NFs communicate with the AMF for delivery of MT data or signalling. The AMF calculates the UE reachability based on the eDRX cycle value for RRC_INACTIVE state provided by NG-RAN and triggers NG-RAN paging via an N2 DL Data Notification message if the UE is considered reachable as specified in clause 4.8.2.2b of TS 23.502 [3]. Otherwise, the AMF stores the information received in the NF request and replies to the requesting NF to apply high latency communication functions as specified in clause 5.31.8 based on eDRX cycle for RRC_INACTIVE (e.g. an Estimated Maximum Wait Time is calculated based on eDRX cycle value for RRC_INACTIVE). When the AMF determines that the UE has become reachable for paging, the AMF uses the stored information to send an N2 DL Data Notification message.;YES
test;5.31.7.2.4	Paging for extended DRX for RRC_INACTIVE in NR connected to 5GC;When the UE resumes the RRC connection as specified in TS 38.300 [27] (e.g. including mobile originated small data transmission procedure), if the NG-RAN had sent the indication for the CN to handle mobile terminated (MT) communication, NG-RAN proceeds as specified in clause 4.8.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3], which indicates to the AMF that the UE is now reachable for downlink data and/or signalling. The AMF then informs other NFs that the UE is now reachable using the high latency communication functions as specified in clause 5.31.8 and MT data and signalling can be delivered to the UE.;YES
test;5.31.7.5	MICO mode and Periodic Registration Timer Control;If the Expected UE Behaviour indicates scheduled DL communication the AMF should allow MICO mode for the UE and allocate a periodic registration timer value such that the UE performs Periodic Registration Update to renegotiate MICO mode before or at the scheduled DL communication time, if the AMF decides to allow MICO mode for the UE. When UE requests the MICO mode with active time, the UE may also request a periodic registration timer value suitable for the latency/responsiveness of the DL communication service known to UE. If the UE wants to change the periodic registration timer value, e.g. when the conditions are changed in the UE, the UE consequently requests the value it wants in the registration procedure. The AMF takes the UE requested periodic registration time value into consideration when providing the periodic registration timer to UE during Registration procedure as specified in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3].;YES
test;5.31.8	High latency communication;5.31.8	High latency communication;YES
test;5.31.8	High latency communication;"Functions for High latency communication may be used to handle mobile terminated (MT) communication with UEs being unreachable while using power saving functions as specified in clause 5.31.7 or due to discontinuous coverage as described in clause 5.4.13. ""High latency"" refers to the initial response time before normal exchange of packets is established. That is, the time it takes before a UE has woken up from its power saving state and responded to an initial downlink packet or signal.";YES
test;5.31.8	High latency communication;When a NR RedCap UE requests to use the power saving functions as specified in clause 5.31.7, then the AMF may, based on local policy, reroute the Registration Request to another AMF that supports High latency communication as specified in clause 6.3.5.;YES
test;5.31.8	High latency communication;High latency communication is supported by extended buffering of downlink data in the UPF, SMF or NEF when a UE is using power saving functions in CM-IDLE state or in RRC_INACTIVE state, or when the UE is using a satellite access with discontinuous coverage and the UE is not reachable. For UPF anchored PDU sessions the SMF configures during AN release or when NG-RAN indicates via the AMF the UE is in extended DRX for RRC_INACTIVE, the UPF with user data Forwarding Action Rule and user data Buffering Action Rule according to TS 29.244 [65]. The rules include instructions whether UPF buffering applies or the user data shall be forwarded to the SMF for buffering in the SMF. For NEF anchored PDU sessions only extended buffering in the NEF is supported in this release of the specification. During the Network Triggered Service Request procedure or Mobile Terminated Data Transport procedures when using Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, the AMF provides an Estimated Maximum Wait Time to the SMF if the SMF indicates the support of extended buffering. The SMF determines the Extended Buffering Time based on the received Estimated Maximum Wait Time or local configuration. The handling is e.g. specified in the Network Triggered Service Request procedure, clauses 4.2.3.3, 4.2.6, 4.24.2 and 4.25.5 of TS 23.502 [3].;YES
test;5.31.8	High latency communication;High latency communication is also supported through notification procedures. The following procedures are available based on different monitoring events:;NO
test;5.31.8	High latency communication;An AF may provide parameters related to High latency communication for different methods to UDM, via NEF, as part of provisioning capability as specified in clause 5.20. The UDM can further deliver the parameters to other NFs (e.g. AMF or SMF) as specified in clause 4.15.6 of TS 23.502 [3].;YES
test;5.31.16	Service Gap Control;"Service Gap Control is an optional feature intended for CIoT UEs to control the frequency at which these UEs can access the network. That is, to ensure a minimum time gap between consecutive Mobile Originated data communications initiated by the UE. This helps reducing peak load situations when there are a large number of these UEs in an operator network. Service Gap Control is intended to be used for ""small data allowance plans"" for MTC/CIoT UEs where the applications are tolerant to service latency.";YES
test;5.31.16	Service Gap Control;NOTE 1:	Time critical applications, such as regulatory prioritized services like Emergency services can suffer from the latency caused by the Service Gap Control feature. Therefore Service Gap Control feature is not recommended for subscriptions with such applications and services.;YES
test;5.33	Support for Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication;5.33	Support for Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication;UNSURE
test;5.33.1	General;The following features described in 5.33 may be used to enhance 5GS to support Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC):;NO
test;5.37	Support for high data rate low latency services, eXtended Reality (XR) and interactive media services;5.37	Support for high data rate low latency services, eXtended Reality (XR) and interactive media services;YES
test;5.37.1	General;This clause provides an overview of 5GS functionalities for support of XR services (AR/VR applications) and interactive media services that require high data rate and low latency communication, e.g. cloud gaming and tactile/multi-modal communication services according to service requirements documented in TS 22.261 [2]. The standardized 5QI characteristics for such interactive services are provided in Table 5.7.4-1 and TSCAI is used to describe the related traffic characteristics as defined in clause 5.27.2. Further enhancements for these interactive media services are as follows:;YES
test;5.37.3.1	General;L4S (Low Latency, Low Loss and Scalable Throughput) is described in IETF RFC 9330 [159], IETF RFC 9331 [160] and IETF RFC 9332 [161]. It exposes congestion information by marking ECN bits in the IP header of the user IP packets between the UE and the application server to trigger application layer rate adaptation.;YES
test;5.37.6	UL/DL policy control based on round-trip latency requirement;5.37.6	UL/DL policy control based on round-trip latency requirement;YES
test;5.37.6	UL/DL policy control based on round-trip latency requirement;For XR and other interactive media services that require very low Round-Trip (RT) latency, Uplink-Downlink policy control may be supported to meet the RT latency requirement. RT latency requirement is the upper bound for the sum of UL delay and DL delay of a data flow between UE and N6 termination point at the UPF. PCF may support Uplink-Downlink policy control based on RT latency requirement based on an RT latency indication from AF during the AF session with the required QoS procedure as defined in clause 4.15.6.6 of TS 23.502 [3].;YES
test;5.37.6	UL/DL policy control based on round-trip latency requirement;The AF can provide an RT latency indication with a single direction delay requirement between the UE and the PSA UPF expressed as the QoS Reference parameter or individual QoS parameters (as defined in clause 6.1.3.22 of TS 23.503 [45]). The RT latency indication indicates the need to meet the RT latency requirement for data flow, i.e. doubling of the single direction delay requirement between the UE and the PSA UPF expressed by the QoS Reference parameter or individual QoS parameter.;YES
test;5.37.6	UL/DL policy control based on round-trip latency requirement;PCF determines the data flow's UL PDB and DL PDB based on the RT latency requirement. The UL PDB and DL PDB can be unequal, but their sum shall not exceed the RT latency requirement. The PCF shall generate two PCC rules, one for UL QoS flow for UL traffic of the data flow and one for DL QoS flow for DL traffic of the data flow, respectively. PCF shall assign the 5QIs for each of these two PCC rules according to the derived UL PDB and DL PDB.;YES
test;5.37.6	UL/DL policy control based on round-trip latency requirement;To support UL and DL delay tracking, the QoS monitoring for UL packet delay and the DL packet delay (as defined in clause 6.1.3.21 of TS 23.503 [45]) shall be triggered respectively to request tracking the UL packet delay of the QoS flow used in UL and DL packet delay of the QoS flow used in DL independently. Based on the QoS monitoring results, the PCF may readjust the UL PDB and/or DL PDB under the consideration of the RT latency requirement to better fit the new situation.;YES
test;5.37.6	UL/DL policy control based on round-trip latency requirement;NOTE:	How the PCF derives the round-trip latency and takes policy decisions is up to the implementation.;NO
test;5.43.3.1	General;NOTE:	The latency optimisation that can be gained by inter-satellite link between UPFs on different GEO satellites depends on the distance between the satellites that can be substantial, depending on the number of deployed satellites.;UNSURE
test;5.43.4	Reporting of satellite backhaul to SMF;If dynamic satellite backhaul is used by the NG-RAN, i.e. capabilities (latency and/or bandwidth) of the satellite backhaul change over time due to e.g. use of varying inter-satellite links as part of backhaul, the AMF notifies the SMF of the corresponding dynamic satellite backhaul category to serve the PDU Session.;YES
test;M.1	Mapping of the parameters between 5GS and TSN UNI;‐	MaxLatency: set to CN PDB subtracted by maximum possible buffer duration in Talker. Maximum possible buffer duration is set to LatestTransmitOffset subtracted by EarliestTransmitOffset.;YES
test;M.1	Mapping of the parameters between 5GS and TSN UNI;‐	MaxLatency: derived as with the corresponding information for the Talker group.;UNSURE
test;M.1	Mapping of the parameters between 5GS and TSN UNI;"‐	AccumulatedLatency: If the AccumulatedLatency is included from TN CNC to SMF/CUC for a stream in DL direction, the SMF/CUC may use the AccumulatedLatency to update the TSCAI BAT to the NG-RAN; the SMF sets the TSCAI Burst Arrival Time in downlink direction as the sum of the TSCAC BAT value in downlink direction and AccumulatedLatency and the buffer duration in Talker in CN-TL. The buffer duration in CN-TL is zero if TimeAwareOffset for the Talker group is not present, and TimeAwareOffset - EarliestTransmitOffset if the TimeAwareOffset is present for the Talker group.";YES
