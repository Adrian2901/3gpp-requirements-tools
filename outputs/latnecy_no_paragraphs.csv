22876-j00;5.2.1	Description;Thus, as an offloading strategy, we can imagine that a model is split between 2 robots because it has been established that for a particular AI/ML model, the latency with the sidelink communication was better (smaller) than with the regular 5G communication path, as stated in [12] and [13].;NO

22876-j00;5.2.1	Description;The current Use Case promotes the scenario (C) where a model M is split in two sub-models Ma and Mb. If both robots (UEs) have a similar computing power, the assumption is that the latency due to the inference of model M is almost equal to the latency of model Ma plus the latency of model Mb.;NO
22876-j00;5.2.1	Description;Hence, once the split model is deployed on the two robots (UEs), the aim is to minimize the E2E latency and to be as close as possible to the non-split case. This is done with a transfer delay of both the intermediate data and the inference results as small as possible. We can note that if the computing power on the assistant robot is more important, then scenario (C) would be the preferred scenario.;NO

In Figure-1, the green and purple lines respectively represent the local ML parameter transmission of original FL and the FL with decentralized averaging methods. Due to the transmission latency requirement, only 4 devices can participate in original FL.
