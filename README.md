## :bulb: About the project
In this project we aimed to use the assisstance of the Large-language-Models(LLMs) in order to extract useful requirements from 3GPP standards.
With advances in generative AI and large language models (LLMs), we can now leverage these tools to automate the extraction of requirements from complex technical documents. Traditionally, requirements elicitation from dense standards like 3GPP has been time-consuming and requires lot of manual work. This project aims to address these challenges by using LLMs to streamline the extraction process, reducing manual effort, improving accuracy, and making the process more efficient and reliable.

Tech stack used in the project: 
* Ollama 
* Mini-cpm
* Python
