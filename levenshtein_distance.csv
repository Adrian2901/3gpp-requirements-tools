Communication services supporting cyber-physical control applications need to be ultra-reliable and, in some cases, the end-to-end latency must be very low. Communication for cyber-physical control applications supports operation in various vertical domains, for instance industrial automation, Smart Grid . $157$78$177
<b>end-to-end latency:</b> as defined in TS 22.261 [2].$21$41$43
<b>factory automation: </b>automation application in industrial automation branches typically with discrete characteristics of the application to be automated with specific requirements for determinism, low latency, reliability, redundancy, cyber security, and functional safety.$134$75$189
NOTE 7:	Low latency typically means below 10 ms delivery time.$21$22$1
Communication services supporting cyber-physical control applications need to be ultra-reliable, dependable with a high communication service availability, and often require low or (in some cases) very low end-to-end latency.$103$79$143
Determinism refers to whether the delay between transmission of a message and receipt of the message at the destination address is stable (within bounds). Usually, communication is called deterministic if it is bounded by a given threshold for the latency/transmission time. In case of a periodic transmission, the variation of the interval is bounded.$112$104$209
In some cases, a local approach (e.g. network edge) is preferred for the communication service on the network side in order to reduce the latency, to increase communication service availability, or to keep sensitive data in a non-public network on the factory site.$167$61$192
Communication service availability is considered an important service performance requirement for cyber-physical applications, especially for applications with deterministic traffic. The communication service availability depends on the latency and reliability (in the context of network layer packet transmissions, as defined in TS 22.261 [2]) of the logical communication link, as well as the survival time of the cyber-physical application (see Annex C.3 for further details on these relations).$232$58$222
High accuracy positioning is becoming essential for Factories of the Future. The reason for this is that tracking of mobile devices as well as mobile assets is becoming increasingly important in improving processes and increasing flexibility in industrial environments, Clause 5.7 provides positioning requirements for horizontal and vertical accuracy, availability, heading, latency and UE speed in an industrial use case scenario.$47$116$117

Transmission infrastructure is a key component of the energy system. Communication enables protection of this infrastructure. The algorithms involved depend on certain constraints must be met, particularly concerning the end-to-end latency.$80$79$121

Table 5.7.1-1 below lists typical scenarios and the corresponding high positioning requirements for horizontal and vertical accuracy, availability, heading, latency, and UE speed.$50$92$124
<b>1)</b>	<b>Factory automation:</b> Factory automation deals with the automated control, monitoring and optimisation of processes and workflows within a factory. This includes aspects like closed-loop control applications (e.g., based on programmable logic or motion controllers) and robotics, as well as aspects of computer-integrated manufacturing. Factory automation generally represents a key enabler for industrial mass production with high quality and cost-efficiency. Corresponding applications are often characterised by highest requirements on the underlying communication infrastructure, especially in terms of communication service availability, determinism, and latency. In the Factories of the Future, static sequential production systems will be more and more replaced by novel modular production systems offering a high flexibility and versatility. This involves many increasingly mobile production assets, for which powerful wireless communication and localisation services are required. $105$131$192
5)	<b>Monitoring and maintenance</b>: Monitoring of certain processes and/or assets in the context of industrial production without an immediate impact on the processes themselves (in contrast to a typical closed-loop control system in factory automation, for example). This particularly includes applications such as condition monitoring and predictive maintenance based on sensor data, but also big data analytics for optimising future parameter sets of a certain process, for instance. For these use cases, the data acquisition process is typically not latency-critical.$181$63$173

"<span style=""font-size:18pt""><b>End-to-end latency: maximum</b></span>"$58$24$41
The communication between the collaborating mobile robots / AGVs requires high communication service availability and ultra-low latency. The exchange of control commands and control feedback is done with periodic deterministic communication and using time-sensitive networking.$154$0$154
In the closed-loop control use case for process automation, several sensors are installed in a plant and each sensor performs continuous measurements. The measurement data are transported to a controller, which takes decision to set actuators. The latency and determinism in this use case are crucial. This use case has very stringent requirements in terms of latency and service availability. The required service area is usually bigger than for motion control use cases. Interaction with the public network (e.g., service continuity, roaming) is not required.$209$86$225

In another case, using telemetry data as input, the digital twin model’s output may be fed to an AR server for sending low latency AR streams toward the manual operator in the factory production area. At the same time, it can further be utilized as input by an AI/ML model.  A process control function can compare the machine data (example:position, rotation level, speed, sensor data, high-speed photography etc.) and perhaps a high-resolution video from the manufacturing line and  if necessary, it can send commands for corrective measure. In this example, the process control functions reside at the edge infrastructure and the inspection related corrective input is sent back to the production system control function.$167$344$210

Due to the criticality of these safety functions, safety control panels currently have mostly a wire-bound connection to the equipment they control. In consequence, there tend to be many such panels for the many machines and production units that typically can be found in a factory. With an ultra-reliable low-latency wireless link, it would be possible to connect such mobile control panels with safety functions wirelessly. This would lead to a higher usability and would allow for the flexible and easy re-use of panels for controlling different machines. $194$139$218
The service bit rate per controller is low in steady state, but GOOSE bursts with high service bit rate do occur, especially during fault situations. GOOSE messages are sent by several or all controller units of the feeder nearly at the same point in time during the fault location, isolation and service restoration procedure with a low end-to-end latency. $213$101$253
High-speed current differential protection, which is required for sub-millisecond fault detection, is another typical use case of power distribution automation. The approach utilises differential current measurements to significantly reduce fault detection time. The protection relays exchange the current samples via the 5G system. Each relay then compares the sent and received samples to determine if a fault has occurred in a protected area. This is done in order to identify and isolate a fault in the grid. The sampling rate varies and is dependent on the algorithms designed by the manufacturers. A protection relay collects the current samples (with the typical message size of up to 245 bytes) at a frequency of 600 Hz, 1200 Hz, 1600 Hz, or 3000 Hz. The exchange of measurement samples is done in a strictly cyclic and deterministic manner. With the sampling rate of 600 Hz, the transfer interval is 1.7 ms and the required bandwidth 1.2 Mbit/s; for 1200 Hz, the transfer interval is 0.83 ms and the required bandwidth 2.4 Mbit/s. The maximum allowed end-to-end delay between two protection relays is between 5 ms and 10 ms, depending on the voltage (see  IEC 61850-90-1 for more details [28]). For some legacy systems, the latency usually is set to 15 ms. The associated KPIs are provided in Table A.4.4.4-1.$288$355$228

On this matter, 5G enables shifting care location from hospitals to homes and others lower cost facilities which mechanically translates into more savings. Additionally, another example showing that 5G can enable cost savings required by the medical industry can be found inside hospitals where wireless transmission of low latency data streams improves operating room planning, enable streamlining equipment usage and simplifies operating theater implementation.$173$75$156
<h1>B.6	Unacceptable deviation from target end-to-end latency</h1>$11$10$16
Cases (a) and (b) are often not classed as an unacceptable deviation from the target end-to-end latency.$1$51$50
The conditions that influence the behaviour of wireless communication are framed by the communication requirements of the application (e.g., end-to-end latency), the characteristics of the communication system (e.g., output power of a transmitter), and the transmission conditions of the media (e.g., signal fluctuations caused by multipath propagation). $57$127$139
<i>End-to-end latency</i>$41$37$9
"There are several time parameters in dependability assessment. A required value is specified for every time parameter. This value can be a maximum, mean, modal, minimum etc. Typically, there is a deviation from the desired value to the actual value. Jitter is often used to characterise this variation. Since jitter generally is used for characterising the behaviour of a measured parameter, for instance the scatter of measured end-to-end latencies (""the world as it is""), it can be quite confusing to use it for formulating service performance requirements (""the world as we want it to be""). What is needed is a concept and related parameters that allow for formulating and talking about the end-to-end latency requirements in Clause 5 and Annex A."$140$182$201
<h2>C.4.2	Network latency requirement formulated by use of timeliness</h2>$49$40$11
In 5G networks, the end-to-end latency KPI is a critical KPI in order to ensure that the network can deliver the packet within a time limit specified by an application: not too early and not too late. $47$79$123
In cyber-physical automation, the arrival time of a specific packet should be strictly inside a prescribed time window. In other words, a strict time boundary applies: [minimum end-to-end latency, maximum end-to-end latency]. Otherwise, the transmission is erroneous. Although most use cases that require timely delivery only specify the maximum end-to-end latency, the minimum latency is also sometimes prescribed. In the latter case, a communication error occurs if the packet is delivered earlier than the minimum end-to-end latency. An example for a related application is putting labels at a specific location on moving objects, and the arrival of a message is interpreted as a trigger for this action. In other words, the application does not keep its own time, but interprets the message arrival as clock signal. Maximum and minimum end-to-end latency alone do not disclose which value is preferred, i.e. target value. The next three subclauses introduce concepts help with relating maximum end-to-end latency, minimum end-to-end latency, and target vale to each other. $149$183$204
"A message reception is considered in time, if it is received within the timeliness interval. If it is received outside the timeliness interval, the message reception is considered invalid. This is related to the communication error ""unacceptable deviation from target end-to-end latency"" (see Subclause B.6). In other words, maximum end-to-end latency = <i>t</i><sub>UB</sub> and minimum end-to-end latency = <i>t</i><sub>LB</sub>."$93$117$169
Using the concepts of earliness and lateness (see Subclauses C.4.5 and C.4.6, respectively), the maximum and minimum end-to-end latency can be rewritten as follows.$48$75$63
<i>Maximum end-to-end latency = target end-to-end latency + maximum lateness;</i>$210$66$168
<i>Minimum end-to-end latency = target end-to-end latency – maximum earliness.</i>$113$43$109
-	End-to-end latency: Time measured from the point when a piece of data received at the CSIF in the source communication device until the same piece of data is passed to the CSIF in the target communication device.$27$46$59
"If not stated otherwise, the terms ""end-to-end latency"" and ""transfer interval"" refer to the 3GPP system / 5G network parameters in this document."$1$78$79
The performance aspects that are covered by/in TS 22.263 [27] (Service requirements for Video, Imaging and Audio for professional applications) also target the latency that these services experience. $36$112$141
This use case will deploy a multiple camera studio of approximately 1,000 m<sup>2</sup> (~5 cameras) where wired and wireless functionalities currently provided by traditional infrastructure technologies are likely to be deployed using a standalone non-public network. A combination of IP enabled wired and wireless cameras working at both HD and UHD resolutions will be deployed in a studio. Associated equipment such as video monitors, prompting systems, camera control will be provided over the 5G network. Camera timing and synchronisation will be provided over the 5G system. As well as video, audio will be sourced from both wired and wireless microphones incl. control/monitoring and combined with the video to produce high quality synchronised AV content. 5G will also be deployed to control lighting and camera robotics. Talkback intercom systems will be deployed using low latency multicast links.$187$158$222
Some approaches may also deploy main (leader) equipment at the broadcast centre with secondary (follower) equipment at the location site to reduce latency. $65$109$88
Other aspects of this workflow may also include robotic control where both the physical position (height, direction and tilt) and the technical control (focus, zoom, iris, colour) of a device of a camera, microphone or light may be controlled remotely. In this instance round trip latency of &lt; 20ms is required in order for an operator to see a move reflected at his control position as it is made.$150$190$334
This scenario describes unicast communication of evenly interspersed packets from application A to B. The packets are handed over at the communication service interface A from the application to the communication network, and the packets are then transmitted to the end node B. However, only every second packet is actually successfully handed over to end node A and then transmitted to end node B. Thus, only half of the packets arrive at application B. Note though that the reliability of the mobile network is 100%, since all packets transmitted by end node A are delivered to end node B within the time constraint required by the targeted service. However, depending on the agreed QoS, the communication service availability can be of the same value as the reliability or much lower. For instance, if the agreed survival time is equal to or larger than the end-to-end latency, reliability and communication service availability are equal. However, if the survival time is smaller, the reliability is two times the communication service availability. $102$297$277
Note that the shortest time interval over which the communication service availability should be calculated is the sum of maximum allowed end-to-end latency and survival time.$1$12$11
